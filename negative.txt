I ordered this as an extra cord for my Asus X202.  Delivery was prompt however the first one that was sent to me didn't fit right in my computer.  It kept sliding out and would not recharge my computer.The seller had included a contact email and asked before we do a review on Amazon to contact them first.  Everyone deserves a chance so I sent an email and the seller did respond.  He was very apologetic and sent out a replacement cord.  This one did fit but before I wrote a review I wanted to make sure that it worked for a while.Unfortunately I have used it for 2.5 weeks and this morning the tip snapped.  This is not a good product and I have ordered another type on Amazon.

Last month the origin ac adaptor of my asus Q200E was dead, so I bought this item for a replacement. What make me amazing is this new one was used for only one month and died again.

This cord worked for about 2 weeks and then the tip snapped. Do not buy this cord. It will be a complete waste of your money.

dont waste ur time or money, lasted a week then cord broke, was small and cool while it lasted, shop on

So I'd only had this for about a week before I unplugged it from my laptop and the head broke off.  I'd only plugged and unplugged it twice before that, so I guess third time is a charm.

I bought this at staples for about $400 end of Jan., spent 130 bucks for MS office, another 100 for the data transfer from my beloved but broken lenovo(my own fault, got dropped during airport transit).And suddenly (early June) this Asus 200E stopped charging, drained out of battery. Too bad I cannot just replace the battery as it is molded in as opposed to some thing you can pop it out. I treated this machine like a baby with utmost care, always kept in heavy padded case n every thing, no gaming, gentle use for just email n skype. Now I am stuck- did not want pay another 70 bucks for staples tech to just diagnose.Sending back to CA for manufacturer, paying for the shipping from out of pocket keeping my fingers crossed.If they replace this with the newer one, I will have buy again new MS office and for data transfer? What are my consumer rights?Besides, this is not even a comfortably machine lousy mouse pad and awful keyboard- It has carpal tunnel syndrome written all over itThe moral for me? is to go for one that is from reputed maker and BACK IT UP all the time- cloud based and on external hard drives

I can't even return this thing because it's past 30 days from the purchase date. Horrible buy, and I paid nearly $500 for this, when I could have bought a Chromebook for about half that price. The problem? It is SO incredibly insensitive to touch (it's got a touch screen in case you didn't know), and even clicking on things can take FOREVER for it to register. I don't like this one bit. I want to sell it, but feel bad about putting someone else through this crap. Don't buy this, buy a Chromebook. The only reason I didn't buy a Chromebook was because it doesn't have a caps lock button (it's got a search button where a caps lock key usually is).

This computer is ridiculously hard to use. About once a month a notification pops up that some crucial update needs to install and gives you 15 minutes before it restarts and updates itself which takes anywhere from 15 minutes to four hours. If you need to do something important on the computer you can't, it just shuts down in the middle of whatever you are doing.It comes with a DVD player attachment, spoiler alert: it doesn't work.Windows 8 in itself is super confusing but the mechanics of this computer make it that much worse.

nothing works.Cannot use the DVD reader have had to re-install multiple times.hard to navigate anythingwaste of money will be happy to sell on Amazon barely used computer

I ordered this laptop because of its legacy hardware ( serial ports, LPT ports, USB ports, and above all else, Windows xp pro)- the purchase / checkout offered 2nd day delivery, yet took over 1 week to arrive- After arriving, inspecting the laptop, it was carefully wrapped, no visible damage was present.After putting everything together, plugging in the power cord, i get an error message that no hard drive is present, i go into the bios, and to my amazement, its still locked with a password, that no one knows-i pulled the Hard drive module out, and inspect everything, i find that the mini IDE header is missing a pin- , i emailed the seller this issue, he sends out another hard drive- a week goes by, and it finally arrives, i opened the package, and notice, it does not have the replacement header that i need to make the hard drive work.Frustrated, i get back on amazon, and search for this header adaptor, lo and behold, for 1.72 each, i buy 5 just to have them around in case i decide to buy another hard drive from these sellers that do not check everything fully.If i had been an everyday normal  'joe-the-consumer', this would have been a disasterous exchange. i gave a low rating because, when you sell something, regardless what it looks like, it should be functional before you ship, (tested, and tried)

non-working system....seller had his personal info/account info stored........not able to WiFi/connected to the internet.... very slow startup and operating system failure.......  also was shipped inappropriately (not packed correctly and was disgustedly filthy and dirty)

cant get on line with it and you cant the anyone to help you....they tell you it is a sold as is after you get it

I've had my HP G60-440US laptop for four months now.  During those four months, the laptop's been out of order (non-functioning) three different times for an aggregate period of about five weeks. During the first month, the hard drive crashed, and I couldn't turn the computer on.  Then the little chippie-thing that allows the computer to connect to my wireless modem broke down.  Most recently, the dvd player died while, at the same time, the new wireless card went kaputt.  Consequently, I've had to send my laptop away to the service department twice, and have had to reinstall some chip or other part so that the computer could pick up a wireless signal.  The computer has been a complete lemon.  My friends warned me about purchasing an HP product, and I didn't listen.One of the worst parts about my HP experience has been the attitude of the customer service people. The technical guys in India were nice enough, but they kept me on the line for more than an hour before they agreed that I wasn't lying about my hard drive having crashed.  My experience with the managers in the U.S. was much worse.  My conversation with customer service - notwithstanding all the scripted "I'm sorry to hear that, sirs" left me feeling absolutely powerless and with the feeling that, now that HP had my $500, they cared not a bit about my needs or satisfaction.So, be warned - this is not a good product.  I wish I had listened to my friends and spent a little more cash for a better product instead of this toy laptop.

My G60 440US ran great right out of the box. After about 10 months I started getting warning messages that my battery was failing. Got a new battery, everything was fine and then one morning shortly thereafter, nothing. Before you buy this machine research online the problems others have had with it. The most common complaint by far is that it won't boot up. It indicates power but you get nothing but a black screen and HP is no help other than suggesting some lame recommendations that involve removing the battery and unplugging the AC adapter, and starting over. A joke. I've bought only HP computers for more than 20 years but this particular laptop has been a complete dud and HP, from all appearances of those who've had similar problems, has nothing to resolve the issue. I wholeheartedly DO NOT recommend this machine.

After using this HP laptop G60 for a year or so, the fan makes this loud noise, its louder then the fridges we have here.  I have a lenovo that is has been on for 3 years straight and its so quite you cant even tell its on when its running at full capacity and these laptops cost the same.Buyers be aware! HPs are terrible laptops, Im a laptop enthusiast and love laptops, I own several from alienware to the lenovo i mentioned above.  Save your money and buy from a reputable notebook seller like Lenovo.

After doing some research, I purchased this computer based on techs and price.  My last laptop was a Dell.  I thought I had made a good decision only to have a key pop off within 2 months.  To get this fixed, I would have to send the computer back to HP and it was not worth the inconvenience of not having my computer to have it repaired.  My computer is now over a year old and out of warranty.  I just found out that my battery failed and will cost $122 to replace.  The battery has a very short life as it is not an Li-ion battery.  Overall, I wish I had spent a few more $$ to get a higher quality product.

I just bought my Notebook this past October 2009. I like the note book and think it is great for what I need it for.HOWEVER!!!! In my package along with many other inserts came an insert for LightScribe (Disc Labeling) On this Insert indorsed by HP it says unbder bullet point"*Burn a custom, silkscreen-quality monochrome label directly onto the face of the disc using the Roxio Creator software alreadyinstalled on all LightScribed-enabled HP PC's."I have spent HOURS with HP's outsourced customer service representatives and also with Case Managers. This inser is very clear that the Roxio creator software was installed onto all LightScribed-enabled HP PC's. I have gone back to Staples and checked ALL of thier instore PC's and they do not have the Roxio Program as well.talking and with the HP Representatives they have basically said they do not use this software anymore and have not for several years. Well, NOT ACCORDING TO THIS INSERT! When talking to HP they basically said have you read the specs. I let her know that I did but this was basically false advertising and she stated "If that is what you want to call it."WOW, this could have been solved very easily a LONG time ago but since the OVERWHELMINGLY HORRIBLE SERVICE I am going to see this one out.Thanks I hope this helps you and contact me with information if you have the same issues.Pdaniel99

I have had nothing but problems getting service for my HP. I get different answers from different people who can't understand me.If you run into a problem, they stink at trying to help. The extra money for a different company is sure to be worth the sloppy job they do on their computers. A mother board they replaced has a problem six months later and they want me to pay them to diagnose the problem that I already have identified. They want me to buy a new motherboard because its "out of warranty."  ?? Too much money to not stand by your product.

HP does not honor their warranty.  After six months the screen failed and showed many lines and some black areas.  This was just for normal operation of opening and closing the screen led.  No force or pressure applied on the screen or lid to open and close.  It is simply a poor quality design for expected operation.  HP blames it on the customer and does not honor their product quality and reliability.  After paying for replacement part plus labor, it will still be the same poor quality component.  Failure as the result of poor design for durability is blamed as damaged by consumer (operator).  I recommend Dell or Toshiba for much sturdier and well built design.  Would you accept this on your car warranty if the door wouldn't function and breaks after six months of normal use without any accident?  HP expects the consumer pays for their poor development.  Customer services were poor and at time insulting.  I hope you don't have to deal with them.  Would you take this risk for your new purchase?

This laptop was great ...at first.....white spot on screen after 4 months of use.  Also imprint of keys is permenantly on screen.  After having this laptop 4 months I was ready to replace it (I replace my laptop once a year) Now having the screen/keyboard issues only progress I will be having to purchase a new laptop earlier than anticipated.  I will not be buying another Samsung.  It is still under warranty but I cant afford to be without a computer while it gets shipped off, fixed, and sent back to me.  I bought this laptop to use for work, not as a backup computer.

i bought this laptop new a year ago....had to be serviced twice in the first 6 months....at least it had a 6 month warranty!!! yikes!!!vista locks up and restarts about once a week ... compaq customer service are real a- holes to work with!!! refused to ship me a new one or refurbed exchange....key board broke the first month ...three keys popped off....heats up like a microwave on your lap!!!!! jeez ...stay away from these ...do yourself a favor and look at the msi windbook u100.... i did... boy iam happy now!!!!dont even think about it!!!!!

They outsource their customer service to India.The computer started to have issues with the cooling system while under warranty. I called and was told they would help me back up some expensive software I had on the computer. They never said they would charge me for help backing up the computer before sending it in. Luckily, I asked if there would be a charge and they finally admitted there would be.  I was then told I would be charged $25  to send in the computer even though the cooling system is a known hardware issue with their computers. I called and was told by customer service that shipping was free - on the return trip back. I had to pay the $25 and there was nothing they would do. Their customer service was not only useless, but also was consistently misleading.Next time I will buy from a company that stands behind its products - like HP or Dell.

6 month after purchase, the left hinge of the screen broke.  The metal snapped into two pieces because the hinge handle has a hole drilled though it, and it cracked right next to the hole.This was during normal use, it broke as the laptop was being opened.I contacted Toshiba, but they say it is not covered because it's physical damage.  I'm highly disappointed in Toshiba's service.  This should be covered by the warranty, even when I read the warranty details, it states it should be covered, but they will not.The hinge should have been better designed in the first place, seems a lot of people have issues with Toshiba satellite hinges breaking.

The computer would not boot up!  Also an "Inspected by Best Buy" sticker was on the laptop.  Who knows why?

Poorly constructed keyboard and touchpad.Then, on top of that, from the beginning it froze 3-4 times a week. Now, 9 months later (I bought the computer in Oct. 2012, it is now Aug. 2013) the fan has broken and there are motherboard issues.Turns out the reseller was not authorized and had not even bought the machine from Vizio, but had bought it from Microsoft. This has voided the warranty. In fact, there isn't even a serial # anywhere on the machine, so somebody clearly removed it. Have no idea if the serial # that was on the box even matches the machine I bought.Vizio refuses to help and ManjaTech, the reseller, refuses to help. So now I'm out over $1000 because the IT tech who I use for minor issues has told me it's not worth trying to fix - that I can buy a new computer for less (and he doesn't sell computers so he's not getting anything out of telling me to buy a new machine).I am utterly infuriated. Save yourself money and hassle and don't go near either ManjaTech or Vizio.

The mouse will make your life miserable. I will do everything I can to return this junk. Also out of the blue it shuts down. I regret every moment of spending money on this laptop. Get something heavier and uglier. At least it will work.

I purchased this computer after buying and returning a MacBook Pro - just couldn't wrap my mind around OS X after 20 years of windows.  Old habits die hard!  This is a fantastic computer - excellent display, trackpad technology getting closer to Apple, excellent construction, and overall excellent performance.  The only problem, and it is major in my opinion, is that the WiFi speed drops to near zero when more than 10 to 20 feet from a router.  The WiFi problem has been extremely well documented on the discussion threads at Notebook Review online.  There is even a Dell representative answering questions and disseminating the latest updates.  As of today, 1 August, Dell does not know if the problem is software (drivers) or hardware related.  Driver updates and swapping the WiFi card to another brand have not yielded success, so signs are pointing to a hardware problem, but nothing has been confirmed by Dell.Bottom line - if WiFi capability at a distance of more than 10 feet from the router is required, purchase with extreme caution until Dell can ensure the issue is fixed.  If Dell cannot offer a fix soon, I will return mine while I still can.

I was originally very pleased.  I noticed the wifi was slower than other devices I have but not terrible.  However I couldn't save anything to one of the drives (it comes with s SSD and a traditional drive, the traditional drive wouldn't allow anything to be saved to it), Dell had me reinstall the OS. Since then while booting up I started getting a message that said one of the disk needed to be checked for consistency, it'd count down to 7 then skip the check.  Dell told me this was nothing to worry about.  Then one day (10 months after purchase) when I tried to shut it down I got the blue screen of death, and the fan became extremely loud.  Now it won't start up.  It doesn't matter if I try to start it in safe mode or regularly, it just goes back to the start up screen and asks if I want to launch startup repair or start windows normally.Update: After spending 1.5 hours on the phone with Dell one day, then over 2 hours today I have decided to never buy Dell again.  Neither one of the tech support people had any clue what was wrong and did not offer any more support than the onscreen instructions.  Well I can read for myself. When the reinstall popped up an unspecified error message they had no clue what to do. I'm now waiting on more restore disc although he couldn't explain how these were any different than the thumb drive, just that I should try them.  I asked about sending the lap top back to get a new one, or just a refund and they said no the lap top is fine.  Really? Because not being able to start up the lap top or reinstall windows is a pretty big problem in my book.

Where to begin? This is the second Dell laptop I've purchased through Amazon in the last 4 months, both worked for about an hour and then completely fried; the first had a faulty video card, this one didn't have the OS installed correctly. While trying to fix it with Dell's oh so wonderful help (sarcasm) the computer has gone from getting jammed at the Dell logo (which is apparently a HUGE problem according to the tech) to now being stuck in an infinite reset loop. The tech said I must have done something incorrectly which is just rude. Piece of garbage is being returned.TL DR;Dell doesn't know how to make computers and their tech team isn't interested in addressing issues that EVERYONE seems to be having.

I bought this laptop from MicroCenter when it was on sale for $450. For an i5 laptop with 4GB of RAM and a 500GB Hard Drive, this seemed like a steal. Now I'm pretty sure I'm the one who was robbed.Less than two months after purchasing this laptop, the top-left part of the keyboard stopped working. I called Lenovo Support which is horrendous (at least when it comes to consumer-grade IDEA products). They said I'd have to send in my laptop with 7 business day turnaround AND pay for shipping (I'd add an exclamation point but I currently can't)I begged them for a CRU (customer replaceable part) because I worked in IT for 5 years and have plenty of experience replacing laptop keyboards, but they wouldn't budge.I really can't afford to be without my laptop for 7 days since I'm a web designer and rely on this to pay my bills. I'm hoping I can just buy a replacement keyboard on eBay or Amazon, but so far, I'm out of luck.Let's put this in perspective...Before this laptop, I had a Toshiba laptop that lasted me 5 years. Now this laptop has lasted me less than two months. In 5 years of IT experience, I have never heard of a laptop that has a dead keyboard after a month and a half of use.If the keyboard dies in less than two months, I can only imagine how long the video card, display, and motherboard are going to last.Don't waste your money on this laptop. I likely will never buy another Lenovo product.

I have the touch version of this laptop.  Well, I own it but I don't actually have it because I sent it to Lenovo about 2 weeks ago for repairs.  First problem, it is built very cheaply.  The two parts on the bottom keep clicking apart when I pick it up to put it on a table or my lap.  I didn't notice that it had clicked apart and tried plugging in the charger but the charger end pushed the port into the computer because the side was clicked apart.  It had clicked apart probably half a dozen times before this and the ports inside would get twisted but I'd always been able to get it clicked together again.  Second problem, the keys and mouse pad are all very flat (not raised like previous computers I've had)  So, I have to  keep looking which of the two mouse buttons my hand is on because I can't feel where I am without looking.  A third problem I had may be more a Windows 8 problem or a problem with having a touch screen than a problem with this actual piece of equipment.  The cursor wanders off when I'm typing so that it will randomly delete sections of what I've typed.  Part of the issue is that there are some new keys on the keyboard that weren't on previous keyboards and if your hand accidentally bumps one of them the computer may close a window or switch to the desktop when you didn't mean to.  I was relying on this computer for work so I have had to manage sharing my husband's work computer while they figure out what they are doing.  The customer service from Lenovo has been a bad experience for me too.  I told them exactly what was wrong when I first called about the problem.  They said to send it in to them but I had to pay the shipping to get it there.  Then after about two weeks, I get an email that the issue isn't covered under warranty and I need to send $187 to have it fixed.  I told them exactly what was wrong when I called in.  It feels a lot like a scam for them to not tell me at that point that it is not covered but then demand money when they have my computer hostage.  I could have had it fixed locally and gotten it back in a few days.  Thankfully, I purchased extra warranty protection through Square Trade and they have told me they will pay the shipping and repair fees Lenovo is charging.  But, I will still be without my computer for 3 to 4 weeks.  I will never buy anything from Lenovo again.

Had to return due to ethernet quitting after 2 days and unable to fix.  Lenovo support said this is a common problem. Also trackball pad was slow and sometimes unresponsive not sure if it was computer or windows  8 problem

Would have been great if it arrived before Christmas,as promised. Had nothing to give my son and he had to leave to go back home with no present. Very disappointed with Amazon Prime. Now have to pay to ship this laptop to my son. I thought the whole idea behind Amazon Prime was free 2 day shipping. What can you do for me?

I hate that this is a gift, and you keep sending emails about it.  How can it be a surprise????????????????????????????????

Just look at the picture, square hard edges, drab black machine with terrible speakers & the worst key pad thats so squirrely (cursor jumps around) & super uncomfortable. Components are cheap as the chinese can throw into this boring machine, again just look at the picture, theres no reason to buy this.

It was advertised as having Windows XP, which was specifically why I was purchasing it. It came with Windows 7.The packaging had no return information nor invoice so I am stuck with it.

The mail tracking for this laptop went seriously wrong.  The seller emailed me to wait and it would sort itself out,When the thing finally arrived, it was filthy inside and outside.  A large sticky smear graced the lid.  Under every key there were long black hairs mashed together with dust and other unidentifiable debris.  The screen was almost opaque from the stuff on it.The T60 is known for being easily user serviceable.  It should have been trivial to reassemble this laptop into its original condition. When it arrived, the palmrest was loose all along its edges;  it had not even been refastened down correctly.Many of the keys had no face on them. This version of the T60 does not have easily replaceable keys and it shouldn't have needed to be done, anyway.  Anyone who is not a touch typist, even though most programmers are, could not easily use the keyboard.The laptop's memory was an unadvertised 512 megabytes.  This is gastropodial by today's standards. Added to this, the laptop would not even boot when the second gigabyte from my failed T60 was added - it would only take  one gigabyte card and one 515 megabyte card.The battery would not hold a minute's worth of charge.  When combined with the fact that the advertised power shortage was no power cord, this would have left a purchaser without a previous similar model without any source of power at all.The video card was so regressed Debian fainted and could not install Gnome.This seller has decided to sell laptops stripped of everything that can be resold and leave it up to the purchaser to find that out. I would not buy from them again.  I did not return this one because in the process of investigating its shortcomings I did change its original state, for example filthy to clean, fastening down the palmrest, etc. and do not want the additional annoyance of dealing with return postage and arguments  over original vs. returned condition.The one thing it did have as advertised, other than a functioning motherboard, working wireless and an irrelevant Windows installation, was the 120 gigabyte harddrive.

I've had my U530 for about a month and its been a love-hate relationship.  The speed, display and overall performance are great, but the wireless connectivity is pretty much unusable.  it drops Internet connections almost continuously.  Just go google the wireless adapter and read about the nightmare!I'm sure Intel will fix this issue someday, but for now its going back.UPDATE 2/25/2014I have purchased a TP-Link USB Wireless adapter ($8.88 - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008IFXQFU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) and disabled the on-board Intel Wireless N 7260 and it is now working great.  In fact, the TP-Link adapter makes the Internet run 2 to 3 times faster than the on-board flakey Intel wireless adapter when it was working.I'm happy again.

Computer died after having it for less than 6 months.  Lenovo Warranty service is poor they forced me to ship it to them (no local service centers to drop it off at) and told me it would be 7 business days before I would get it back (provided they had the parts in stock, if not they could not give me a date).  As for the laptop when it was working my chief compliant is the touchpad and how it jumps from screen to screen instead of just moving the mouse pointer around.  Overall, I will never buy another Lenovo product and would not recommend them to anyone.

The laptop is great but the company doesn't care about customers. Their goal is not to make you happy and loyal customer but just to sell you stuff. I bought Lenovo U530 touch model 59412272 from Lenovo website. The model 59402351 with discrete graphics and 1Tb HDD was unavailable at the time of ordering. Then when my order was on the way, I contacted Lenovo and asked can I return the unopened box without incurring the 15% restocking fee. The answer was NO! No exceptions. I expalained, that I want to order the more expensive model but again, no exceptions. This was my last purchase from them.

The hinge mechanism is faulty workmanship. I bought the laptop in August 2013. The hinge broke and because it is molded to the LCD, ASUS is expecting me to pay $165 as well as shipping ($30.00) for the repair. ASUS will not stand by its warranty even though the hinge initially broke after my owning it only 2 weeks. I have never written a negative review before. However, my frustration with ASUS is extremely high. Repeated emails from a local computer repair man, who is officially sanctioned by ASUS for repairs, have not resulted in anything. He, also, has decided to break all ties with ASUS after this incident.

Bought  this from Best Buy in November of 2012. Within 2 weeks it was crashing with a blue screen. Eventually it started happening so frequently that I called support and they told me it was a hardware problem and I would have to pay to ship it to them. Which is BS because if this is a mess up on their part they should be paying for it and everything that comes with fixing it, including shipping. Next the battery is a joke lol it started out at 100% giveing about 6 hours, then slowly overtime it turned into 100% gives you 1 hour 12 minutes. This is only after 4 months of ownership. WTF. Do Not Waste Your Money.

do not buy  Lenovo ideapad n585,,,.it is just garbage, crashed,crashed, crashed all the time, does not start ,blue screen, ..just garbage

Within two weeks of ownership, the display starts showing random dark lines on the display. I believe it is hardware issue. This one is going back to where it came from.

This thing is trash. I have used Lenovo products for years and am a Lenovo certified engineer working for a Lenovo Authorized Service Provider, so you can only imagine how many of their products I have seen over the years. This is by far the absolute worst product Lenovo has ever made. It's too slow to use, I type far faster than this thing runs. The last Word document I created took forever. I typed three paragraphs and it was still trying to catch up. I removed Windows 8 and went back to Windows 7 with no improvement. After three months of using this thing, I am going to demand that Lenovo refund this junk.

I saw this at the store and thought it looked great. I checked the specs and everything. But what I didn't do was test the keyboard. The keyboard on this is horrible. I would say 25% of the keys I strike do not register. You have to strike extremely hard for the keys to register. I lose a lot of time with my work having to go back and correct my papers for keys that didn't register. This was a waste of $700 for me.

This is my first time to leave a review about a product. Unfortunately it is a bad one.Here is what happened. I have been using a Kensington lock for the last five years for my previous laptop. After I bought this laptop, I started using the lock for the new laptop. I could feel that the lock slot didn't fit the lock in the first few times I used it. And then when I used it the last time a week back, it got stuck and I am not able to pull it out ever since.I used the same combination for the last five years and my colleague have several of the same locks and we use them over the years without any issues until this thing came up. I talked to Amazon and they asked to talk to Acer first, which intended to blame the lock. But I am pretty sure it is the problem with the design of the lock slot. Otherwise, I would have problem with my previous laptop and my colleague would also have problems as we switch laptops all the time.Anyway, Acer doesn't want to be responsible for this issue and I will see if Amazon will eventually stand behind the product they sell.Besides the lock slot issue, the laptop is a bit slow even with a 3rd generation i5 and 6 GB of RAM. It got frozen a few times already within three weeks of usage.The thing I dislike most about the laptop is its keyboard, which is very sticky and so awkward to use. I thought I could get used to it after a while but I still can not after three weeks. One of my co-workers complained about the keyboard when he just tried to type one sentence. "I hate it" was his original word.The viewing angle of the laptop is also so narrow and I have to change the screen from time to time to have a clearer view.I will have to return it to Amazon and hope they can give me full refund as the purchase was made less than a month ago.Some pros:  light and thin with a decent price tag.

Sometimes when the power cord was unplugged from the wall t screen would go black and te only way to get the screen back was to turn the computer off by holding down the power button. Already returned and got a laptop from another company.

Since buying this computer I've had to replace a hard drive after 6 months.  I've had a system crash and it was non recoverable and had to go back to hp-lost some info.  The screen has these weird dots in some programs that move with the windows.  sent it back to have it repaired, they said it was the keyboard and replaced it.  Got it back and same problem.

I had this computer for 4 months and the hard drive crashed one day with no warning. Sony has done little to help and it has to be sent out to be fixed. I have NEVER had such a upsetting issue with a computer so quickly! I will never buy a sony computer again. It was such a waste of over $700.00. Grr. Save your money and buy a Macbook!

Worked just fine for two months and then the computer died.  Every support person I dealt with from Sony was based in India.  Each one of them wants to walk through a 15 minute trouble shooting routine of removing the battery, remove memory, etc.  Non of the trouble shooting solved the issue. After two weeks they sent a repair person to fix the laptop.  He replaced the mother board and the machine was alive again.  Two and a half months later the computer died again.  I called Sony to return the machine for a refund or a new laptop and they refused.  They are planing to send a repair person out again.  Does not sound very cost effective to me.  At this point I would buy any brand of laptop over a Sony.  I understand that sometimes you just get a lemon, the answer is replace the lemon or issue a refund. You really don't want to spend over 15 hours with Sony support!

After four months, the laptop screen stopped working properly.Half of the screen started to look so grainy. Additionally, software vaio care is very slow

I received this computer and in the 2 months that I had it the hard drive crashed, worst of all while i was doing a HW assignment. I had to send it back to Sony to get the hard drive replaced!? Then when I got it back of course everything I purchased was deleted off (Microsoft office, virus software) How crazy that would happen right? Mind you I take excellent care of my computer so it was no fault of my own I just assume I was sold a lemon, I still had all the original plastic on the laptop when it crashed so I sent it back basically brand new. Thank god i had just purchased an extended warranty like a week prior otherwise id be even more SOL lol so What I've learned from this experience personally don't buy electronics on amazon, others experiences hopefully varied.

I have had nothing but problems with this computer from day one. I actually had to return this PC to the store 3 times on the FIRST day because every one that came out of the box was broken in some way - hard drive failures, overheats, and one that wouldn't boot up at all. Finally on the fourth try, we got one that seemed to be ok. WOW, was that wrong!!!I was already VERY wary about even keeping it, but because I had already purchased the extended service policy, returning wasn't an option (according to the store). They said all I could do was exchange it for another of the same model. Probably a bunch of baloney because the store didn't want to be stuck with this piece of junk anymore than I did.The Sony VAIO  computer has had more Blue Screens Failures than the "Blue Man Group", the internet disconnects every 5 minutes, the microphone jack has never worked, and the list goes on and on. Not to mention the fact that Sony service is a joke! Don't even get me started.For those of you who say, oh it's just the luck of the draw - it can happen with any computer brand because all the components are made at the same place ......to you I say...NO WAY!  It is no coincidence that I had to go through 4 of these pieces garbage to even get one that would turn on. I have had nothing but trouble... number 4 was NO charm! And the list of people giving this computer 1 star grows. Wish I could have given it 0 stars!A $700 EPIC FAILURE!!!!!

shipping from Ontrac probably threw the laptop to my front door, the keyboard cover popped out of place.  Need to do something about this type of S&H....; and yeah, I sent it back!

I bought my laptop about 1 month before going to college. It worked perfectly then, but after coming to college the laptop has stopped working. The first time it was in sleep mode and when I came back to turn it on it wouldnt turn on. I pressed the power button, I did the thing with removing the battery and holding the power button for 30 seconds and still nothing. 8 hours later I try to turn it on and it does. A couple days later it has done the same thing except this time its not turning on. I am not sure if its a problem with the hardrive or if its only applicable to my computer but this should not be happening. Also, the speakers do suck if you are going to listen to music or anything, there is absolutely no base and the volume is very low. It also gathers a lot of dust and smudges all over. But otherwise everything is awesome, if it only it would turn on!

Awful speakers, tiny sound, no depth - can't hear it with any other noise in the background - not even with the AC running!!!!! If you need a laptop for anything that involves listening to sounds (playing music, DVDs, audiobooks, using Skype...), forget about it. And the customer service is crap. Simply return it before it's too late.

I received this laptop as a graduation present nearly one year ago to this very month. I asked for this HP Pavillion DV-4 laptop for portability, ease of use, and it's features. For about 7 months, the laptop worked marvelously. And then...The computer began to shut down automatically with nearly 80 percent battery life in it. This seems to be the only problem that this computer has is that the battery life diminishes at an alarming rate. First 2 hours fully charged, then 1 hour and 30 minutes, then 1 hour. Now, I am lucky enough to get even 15 minutes of battery life. I have to keep the computer plugged in at all times so it does not crash. Well, so much for portability.I checked my warranty last week to see if I could get a replacement battery, and found out that my warranty does not cover battery replacement. How interesting that the warranty doesn't cover the only thing that plagues my computer. Overall, this computer would have been a nice 4-star or even 5-star machine, however, the dreadful battery life has made me rate this at 2 stars, and the lack of customer support has also brought it down to 1 star. Some people may say that my review is far too biased, and I should focus on the good parts of the computer. Well, I would gladly love to, however the basic need for a working battery overshadows anything else. How can i honestly focus on the good qualities when the computer keeps crashing without the charger in?And from the reviews I am reading, I am not alone in this.Here is my review overall:PRO's:-Sleek design-Great working touchpad-Very good ram, able to run multiple programs without any problems-Good speakers-Okay webcamCON's:-TERRIBLE battery-The two lone USB ports are too close together; you can only use one at a time (which brings up the question: what's the point of the second USB port?)-Wifi isn't too good; sometimes the connection will be lost for no reason.-A bit of a fingerprint magnetUPDATE:The computer has now officially died: it no longer turns on, plugged in or not. I will never buy from HP again.

My title says it. Board-level failure at one year. Will not boot, even with the repair boot disk; will not even post to the BIOS screen. It's two weeks out of warranty so the bill will be $361 for a new motherboard. Think I'll just sell it on Ebay for parts instead; can't see investing further in it. This is my second recent HP to die prematurely. The last one, which this one replaced, died a similar death in two and a half years. No abuse, no travel, just used around the house. Died looking brand new. I can't see buying another HP at this point, though I've owned a half a dozen over the past ten years. There's something bad going on with that company regarding laptops...

Bought this laptop brand new, about eight months ago, from Amazon.  Last week, I went to open it up from the closed position, and it literally cracked in half.  Total hinge failure.  Despite the fact that it had never been dropped, HP would not honor the warranty, and it cost almost $300 to repair.  Okay, but never HP again.  They make cheap stuff, with known hinge problems, then will not even warranty their lousy hinges.

I bought a HP and had nothing but trouble since day one. It had a 1 year warranty from the company they kept saying to send it in, it would come back worse than before. I sent it in 6 times and still not satisfyed. WILL never buy HP again and I've told my friends also, they don't stand behind their product, I was very disappointed.

USB ports are close to each other. I cannot put an USB flash drive and USB mouse at the same time.  I cannot see what on screen when the ambient light is too bright such as at local coffee shops or outdoor.

Don't buy HP laptops! The firm I work for has 4 elitebooks and they are the most unreliable laptops I have ever run across. Just recently I had to replace a hard drive, display and motherboard in an elitebook that was 15 months old. Dealing with HP support (based obviously in India) was a nightmare! I told them that it was extremely important to have these problems fixed ASAP so they said that they would send out a tech with the parts to replace them. Later that afternoon I received the quote from HP for the parts and labor to fix the machine that was still under the parts warranty and it came out to $2400. That's right $2400 to fix a $2300 machine! Needless to say the appointment with the tech was canceled, and it is now four days later and HP has still not come up with a reasonable fix to my problem. Stay away from all HP laptops! Hardware is cheap and unreliable, and customer service is a joke!! You have been warned.

Before you buy HP, research "HP pavilion freezes, lock ups, lawsuits".I have a Pavilion and it's unusable due to regular motherboard-related lock ups, 6 months after the warranty expired, and I'm not alone.I have no intention of ever buying an HP laptop again, and if you do your homework, you  might not either.

I hate HP.  I have a DV4 Pavillion laptop.  The unit is designed poorly.  From the start it likes to jump the cursor around when you are typing.  This is due to poor design of the trackpad.  Next it runs hot and overworks the heatsink fan.  Before getting this one I purchased a turion laptop which also had defects and this was sent as a replacement.  I have had two HP photosmart printers that were likewise poorly made.  I will never buy HP again.

It literally fell apart after 15 months.HP does not stand by their products:A small crack started near the hinge and the screen literally split apart making it impossible to close and then it just stopped working all together.This laptop was very carefully taken care of and never abused or dropped.We brought it in to Best Buy and they said it should have lasted a lot longer than that and they could clearly tell it was never dropped or abused.Went round and round with HP to no avail. They do not stand by their products. Best Buy gave us a $100 off a new laptop because they felt bad aboutthe situation and of course we did not purchase another HP and never will !!!

I am a software engineer who has used a variety of brands. I got a 3 month old DV6t-2000 i7 quad core with 8GB RAM for development purposes. I trusted in HP brand and bought this computer to see that there is absolutely no support. The computers GET issues from time to time, a well performing computer does not necessarily mean that it is a good product.The support department is going to offer you to replace the whole panel and reformat the PC if one of your key-caps(in my case up arrow) gets loose or broken. You will have to leave your PC to service department for at least a month if you have warranty, and if your warranty is over may God help you since your will have to pay several hundred dollars. There is absolutely 0 initiative, and prepare to talk to human robots. I went up to their CEO! and could not get a resolution. Managers are arrogant and chooses to fight with the customer instead of offering solutions.I am an IT expert and strongly suggest advanced and novice users to stay away from HP as far as possible...

I bought HP Pavilion dv5-1251nr in June, 2009 from a reputed US store.After purchase, for first few months my laptop was fine but thereafter from mid Dec'09, I started to face issues of continuous mild noise emitting from the right top corner of laptop (where power cord is attached to the body) while booting my laptop or running anti-virus scan on hard drive.I hear a metallic click click sound also (that comes twice) when I switch on my laptop by pressing power button. Again, I hear continuous noise during shut-down which is similar to that occurring during start-up and it emits similar mild noise when I open or save files from / to hard disc. This is not even one year after purchase and naturally, I started wondering how a quality (?) product can start behaving abnormally within a few months.I contacted HP tech support (1 800 474 6836) who operates from all over India (cities of Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata etc.) for last few days and each time, a different technical assistant would handle the complaint when I would explain and repeat the same thing to them. Each technical person would suggest different opinions and ask to try out a service pack and/or trouble shoot different options sometimes for more than an hour but were unable to make any conclusion when it is simple and clear from the very noise that it is purely a mechanical problem and not related to vista operating system or any driver software. Some of them promised to replace the hard disc but, seemed to be extremely cautious and each time they would request me to do more repeated troubleshooting.More interestingly, HP technical assistants from Kolkata seemed to respond under a dubbed name as when I asked last name of one of them, he replied that they would not expose their names to customers !!!However, this is not the practice for HP technical assistants from Hyderabad or Mumbai !!!Exasperated, I filed a complaint at HP site ([...]) where they allow customers to fill in a complaint form when there is no provision for US customers (or any US state)! However, I entered my details clubbing all information in different form fields. I got a complaint identification number and was notified that it had been recorded and would be forwarded to the relevant department.However, I do not have any status update from HP as yet as to redress of my complaint !!!Unfortunately, I did not check and investigate reputation of HP - after sales support before laptop purchase. There are numerous complaints and posts about HP products and especially about its apathy to prompt service... some of the posts indicate that to tackle customer complaints, HP employees write favorable reviews about HP and its products over internet !!!I came to know that a number of customers filed law suit in China against HP and verdict went in customers' favor and HP had to comply with court order.Please read following posts before buying any HP product because of awful and atrocious service of this company !!!The last link gives a comparative analysis of HP with other reputed brands in the market (HP finishes last !!!).1. [...]2. [...]3. [...]Hope this information is useful !

would you to send in the sofware with spanish version?HP Pavilion DV4-2161NR 14.1-Inch Laptop (Digital Plaid)

i was very insecure about this computer.then i received it and it was not all I expected it to be. if you want a computer just buy a new one and you have factory garantee. they also took very long to give  me back my money-

Because I cannot rewrite a review for Kelly, because she asked me to take the last one down, I will write the review here. I bought this computer in August and the hard drive has already died and the computer is completely unusable. I am very disappointed with Amazon for not letting me write a review on this seller, because people should know what sort of lousy, unreliable products she is selling. If I could give this 0 stars, I would! So unhappy. What a waste of over $200.

This was not what i expected, DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOU KIDS USE BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT LIKE IT. If they want to play games on the internet or download games you can't, because the operating system is too old to run games.

i gave it on christmas as a gift it already broke 1/3/12, child is now very unhappy and im out the money great way to do business

This apple Ibook G4 is now what I expected to be with camera video , and with profesiional internet and I really hate it !!!! Now I buyed one new computer from Apple store in store because I went to Apple store for buy a professional computer ! So I recomand you do not buy from interneet  if you really want something very good and don't buy anymore this things from internet and buy a professional one and with professional is less viruses but not from Internet and go in store better because in internet they lie !!

When browsing the internet the screen zooms in and you have no control of viewing. Also the screen display shuts off or gets frozen when shifted into a different position.

My school bought these for the teachers. I've had it for two weeks. The screen will not turn on after being in sleep/hibernate/shut down. Eventually it will come on after 3-4 forced shut downs using the power button. It already needs to be sent back for repairs.

Got mine a week ago. The touch screen is buggy  and very unreliable and requires restarts. I bought the system for speed, ITs VERY slow! Constantly having to reboot, ect., ect. It pisses me off I feel the need to spend the time to warn others. Don't buy it!! Mines headed to the dump! POC I'm going back to Dell!

title says it all. besides the buggy screen the constant crashes i had my hard drive go twice. not replacing this time.one positive is I now externally back up everything on a regular basis

I started a new job in January and they gave me the Lenovo S230u Twist. My new boss said it would be great for presentations and it's very flexible and that the company will be giving their sales people this product in the future. Do not buy this machine! Yes, it does rotate and you can make presentation with it but you can do the same thing with a normal laptop for less money!The keypad is the worst in the industry. It's upside down where the left and right buttons are near the keyboard not your thumbs. The corners of the mouse pad can be pressed but the pressure is inconsistent and the cursor is constantly moving around by itself.I own a Samsung Note 10.1 and it outperforms the twist hands down. The Note's screen is too small for more than one-on-one presentations however. But I have eliminated my paper notepad and do everything electronically.The Twist has a touch screen but doesn't offer a stylus for handwriting, something I love about the Note. All you end up doing is getting the screen dirty touching it. The screen resolution is poor as well. If the Twist did handwriting recognition I could live with the warts it has, but it doesn't.The Twists case has a matte black or grey finish and it sucks up finger oils and constantly looks dirty. Don't eat or snack while working because whatever you eat will end up on the case or mousepad. Bad design.The Twist can swivel. So what? Turn a normal less expensive laptop around and you can accomplish the same thing.The Twist crashes randomly. I don't know if it's because of Windows 8 or the unit itself but it's feels like the old school pc's that would just crash for no reason.The keyboard is weird as well. The delete key is above the backspace key. Not well thought out at all.This machine gets an "F-" for form, function, and price.Buy something else.

This year I bought a lenovo computer using your services and it came with the hard drive damage. I had to fix it twice in less than a year. The international waranty I paid doesn't work, they take more than a  month to fix it and they make you do everything. My experience with lenovo have been terrible, it's not a quality device.

This is bad. Troll i actually didn't buy it I just put a terrible rating for fun teehee tehee teehee trolled

****Edit.  Down to one star.  Battery won't charge over 88% and just stops charging....saying 'plugged in not charging'.  At 88% it said I had three hours, got on the plane and it died in 35 minutes.  Oh and Windows 8 still is all bad.So  I will start with the negative.  I got this notebook this past weekend for a trip to Chicago for work.  I usually lug around a 15lb Dell laptop and just didn't want to this time.  The battery barely makes it three (3) hours, I actually chatted with Asus support yesterday and they confirmed that is normal.  Yet it says 5 hours in the description.  I am going to return it when I get home and try the ASUS VivoBook X202E-DH31T 11.6-Inch Touch Laptop.I can also hear the hard drive at times like it's working really hard to just browse the web.Dislike Windows 8, but that has nothing to do with the notebook.Positives:Screen is great when I watched a movie, very clear.  A little glare.Touchscreen is nice too, very responsive.Keyboard takes some getting used to so small, but once used to the size it's good.So much nicer to carry for work than my giant Dell

This thing will not even play basic video without crashing and distorting. Just terrible. This thing will not even do what my iPhone can do perfectly. Avoid this at all costs.

The computer is a great size and the screen looked great but it crashed beyond repair within two weeks of being used. We tried to install Microsoft office and the entire computer went down beyond repair! We returned it and will not be buying this brand again. Amazon was great in facilitating the return process.

It was a L850 sattelite, custom made. I had to wait for a month directly from Toshiba! I opened it, the display was cracked ( the liquid was visible and going around and behind the screen,)Then I sent it back another month passed by... they sent me a supposedly a new one! In two weeks, my keyboard keys mulfunctioned, this time! I sent it back, ( By the way, every time you send it back, you have to pay shipping!) No mercy, from Toshiba on that!! Even you have a guareentee! Second time when I received the laptop back, I got all numbers of keyboard mulfunctioned again! So, I send it back, paid the shipping..3 rd time!!! Now, hardware failure message is coming up on the screen! So, I am tired of this and I really wanted to get Asus or Samsung to begin with! Since Toshiba has a great and reliable name I decided to order it, from Toshiba.Please and please buy any other brand but Toshiba!! You will be better off!!!

The laptop froze the first time I used it.  I have not even figured out how to turn off the laptop after 2 weeks. Today, the mouse stopped working. I gave up.  It is a junk of a laptop.  Hard to get around and find what you want or need. I am very disappointed in my parchase.

Every laptop I've had in the past ,comes with a product key for the trial Microsoft Office, I purchased this one (and another under a different account) and both are missing this vital piece of information. This makes me think these computers are suspect and do not have genuine Microsoft software loaded on them, which as you know, voids all warranties and for the $800 I spent on both of these I should have authenticity. Am I mistaken?

Please do not buy laptop. It would not turn on. Charge light comes on, keyboard lights up but the screen remains white. Very frustrated needed it for school on Monday, now I have to go to library ............

The laptop broken, after slight fall, I wrote to seller several messages, I wanted to buy the park, which is broken, but they are ignoring my messages. Laptop broken in 5 month, I think it is not good quality laptop,` and also seller is not interested to solve this problem.

The product after using for 6 months has the hinges coming off. Sent the laptop to Sony to repair since it is still under warranty. They have refused to repair for free.It is not a good product despite paying a premium price. Sony customer service also is not good.I would in future go for competitor's laptops.

I recently return the one that I get. Is the worst laptop I had ever get . The hard disk was defective, the touchscreen doesn't work fine and turn off frecuently without any cause. Don't buy this junk.

The WiFi only has one or two bars at most even when my other laptops are able to connect with full service. I called support and they were unable to resolve the issue even after downloading the new WLAN driviers. I just decided to return this to Amazon.

Sony Vaio is a Crap,i lost all my money on this crap,too much money just to get the worst service ever.Sony is not responsible, and they don't support their products.

these people sold me a totally defective machine, there was no operating system, hard drive and optical drive were defective after spending $800 dollars for a machine that was advertised to be in good working condition.

I BOUGHT MY MAC BECAUSE A FRIEND ADVISED ME TO "GET ONE AND I'LL NEVER HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER LAPTOP FOR YEARS". THIS MAYBE TRUE ABOUT APPLE MAC BUT MACBOOKS FROM SOCALDEALS ARE FRAUD!!! FIRST THING HAPPEN THE DARN TRACKPAD WAS DEFAULT (IMAGE HAVING A TRUE GHOST IN UR MACHINE) SO IT MOVED AND MADE CHANGES TO MACBOOK WITHOUT MY INTENTIONS!!!!! AFTER DECOVERING OTHER DISLIKES ABOUT MY PURCHASE I CONTACTED SOCALDEALS BEFORE 90 WINDOW  FOR RETURN THEN WAS TOLD BY SOCAL REP TO HOLD OFF RETURN UNTIL I RETURN STATESIDE AND THAT THEY'LL FIT ONCE I GET HOME. I'M MILITARY IN AFGHANISTAN SO I HAD TO WAIT FOR LEAVE BEFORE I COULD GET HOME AND GET IT FITS!!!! WHEN IT WAS TIME ONCE I GOT HOME BAM! "YOU'VE WENT PASSED THE WARRENTY ALLOWED, YOU'LL HAVE TO RETURN PRODUCT AND LOSE 25% RESTOCK FEE. I ENDED UP PAYING FOR REPAIRS MYSELF PLUS CONTINUE TO FIND MORE AND MORE THINGS WRONG WITH THIS LAPTOP! DO URSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T BUY REFURBISHED MAC LAPTOPS FROM SOCALDEALS!!!!!!  SCAM/SCAM/SCAM/SCAM/SCAM.....

I have both PC's and Macs.  I have always loved my mac's.  But buying this laptop was a mistake.  I would like to think it was just one lemon, but my daughter bought one about a year ago and it has been taken in for service a couple times and it makes horrible noises that the apple repair person can't seem to hear.  My MacBook Pro is just falling apart.  It has never worked right always freezing up, way to hot and battery's going bad.  The beautiful exterior is coming off.  I don't know what happened to apple.  My daughter had a 13" apple laptop that was great for years.  We had a couple imac's over the years with no problems.  I am now looking for a desktop and would like to trust Apple products but for the $$$ I am going to go PC.  My husband and other daughter both have HP laptops and they are so much better in every way (like they work) than the MacBook Pro.  I was alway's backing Apple when it came to what computers to buy in our family, sorry to say there will be no arguement from me.

I'm a PC guy, I've owned PC for 20 years and done professional support on them for over a decade and I've never seen service as I've seen with the Macbook Pro 15"The Machine itself is sleek and pretty, the display looks nice and it has a comfortable fit to it.  The processor etc seems to do what needs to be done and does it well.  It is however twice the price of a compatible PC.That in itself wouldn't be much of a problem.  Until there was a problem.My son wanted a Mac, as his first machine, since he was paying for it we checked out Macs and bought this model, he was very pleased with it until he opened up the casing yesterday and the display looked like the a squashed spider from a Garfield cartoon.I drove the hour to the apple store and am currently sitting in it.  I talked to a manager named Lloyd and a "genius" named Henry and they informed me that the damage was our responsibility and that repairs would cost $1100.  That is 70% of the cost of the machine and that price alone is more expensive than a compatible Windows 7 machine.I have been involved in customer service for a lot of years and I've never seen anything so short sighted in my life, my son will be purchasing a lot of machines over the next 40 years, I'll be purchasing several myself and have another son who will be going to college in a couple of years.  As a technical support person I am called to recommend machines and companies.  The willingness to discard customers once the money is in hand is beyond anything I've ever seen in my life.I'm afraid that slick media and good actors selling a product is no replacement for actual customer service.You couldn't get me to buy an apple now with a federal bailout.  And you shouldn't either!

Here I ordered the item as advertised with Snow Leopard, and it arrives with the OLD operating system. I feel cheated and there is no way to get it back to Amazon from South Africa AT THERE COST. I've paid for the item, and Amazon makes a HUGE error.

like any other computer you could run, be it osx, windows, linux, what have you...this computer will allow you to surf the web and read email (lets face it, thats all you use it for). the difference is this beast will cook your lap. i've never had a laptop (even other apple laptops) that generated so much heat. a laptop cooler is required if you buy this computer. furthermore the combo trackpad/mouse button is an utter disaster. i don't know anyone who really likes it.

You're paying for the brand name if you get this laptop. Take a look at this laptop for around 600-700 bucks only.HP Pavilion dv7 6c95dx Intel CoreThis laptop is the one I have. Now look at the specs. You get longer battery life, a second generation core i7 performing just as good as this laptop, ram just as good as this laptop, an optical drive,and tons of ports and functionality for what.. 700 bucks! There's only a good graphics card in this Razer laptop, but Razer is telling you that a GTX 660M is worth $1800. No way! By the way, this laptop is just as heavy as the laptop I'm using right now. It is NOT light. One more thing, if you think thickness is very important, let me try to convince you otherwise. This laptop I'm using is maybe .25 of an inch thick, but what's wrong with that? You can't fit a whole textbook in .25 in. You can probably fit a very slim folder, but that's it. Look at the weight; it's still going to be bulky.If you want a good gaming laptop, look for Alienware. The 14 inch performs just as good. Everything is the same, except for its thickness. As I said earlier, what's so good about having something a little less thick? Not very much... (I didn't research but the Alienware is probably around .75 in. more thick, which is a space where you can't fit much.PS: If you hate Alienware, don't say that here, since you should hate Razer even more for super-expensive laptops that do not perform very well.. Just saying that to any Alienware haters looking at this Razer page. I admit that a cheap gaming desktop can be easily made, but this is chat about a gaming laptop. Also, keep in mind that I did not buy this product. This is just my opinion of this laptop when I saw this outrageous price. Buy it if you want, but if you want a decent laptop, take a look at the link above, or visit Alienware for a good gaming laptop.

I recieved my laptop and after five minutes from turning it on it had a blue screen and it's very slow and it takes ten minutes to get iTunes to come on. I am very disappointed with the condition of this product. None of this was mentioned n the description. I have to take the laptop somewhere to get it up to speed

I have this a low rating because I bought this computer and had it for about a week... it made a lot off noise and ran very hot.. later ib found out that it had a bad mother borded and my whole computer chased.. I lost everything I had saved to it'd pictures, school work everything .. and it was costly to get it fixed...

I just bought this device a few days ago...The tablet mode is so not working!...and the seller did not input this in the product description!...I am so disappointed with this issue!...I tried flickering and pointing the stylus pen it came with it and nothing is working!...How can amazon sell something that is not fully functional?!...I thought that amazon had to test and verify items before selling them online?...wow, what a joke this turned out to be!!!!...I don't know if its the stylus pen or the screen that is not functioning properly.  But all i know is that this just came in the mail and i was so excited to see it, but once i tried using it the tablet mode is so broken and not working at all!!!!!...at all!!!  Shame on them sellers trying to rip-off customers for their money!...

don't buy this product!I purchased this laptop Friday after Thanksgiving.... seemed like a good laptop, i5 etc. However - it is SLOWER than my husband's 3 year old laptop!Can't believe how slow it is... you sit there waiting an entire minute or minute+30 seconds for it to do something or for it to load a page on the internet - while my hubby's laptop zips along on our internet (yes, we have the premium faster internet) - and my Mac zips along as well.Wish I could return it.guess I will sell it somewhere - to someone who doesn't mind a bit of a slow machine.

I was excited to get this laptop, but had problems with it from the beginning. The battery stopped working about two months after I bought it, and I had to send it in for repairs. Even though it was only a problem with the battery, HP erased my whole hard drive. Several months later my laptop started turning off without warning. HP suggested I reseat the memory, and the cheap plastic piece holding the memory snapped off when I moved them. This didn't resolve the problem, as my computer got progressively worse and eventually wouldn't even start. HP wouldn't cover the repairs, because I didn't have the "right" warranty. When I sent it in anyway, they told me the motherboard and hard drive needed to be replaced. Knowing the hard drive was fine, I didn't have them repair it, though they still want to charge me for their incorrect diagnosis. Another company repaired it by flashing the bios. Nothing was wrong with the hard drive. Several months after that I'm again having problems with my laptop turning off when I touch it in certain places and the graphics card isn't working correctly. Also, hp has told me I owe them several hundred dollars for repairs they haven't completed. I've had this laptop less than a year.

I haven't even had this laptop for a year an the screen is coming off the hinges. It's never been dropped or anything. I'm so disappointed though. I bought this because I'm in an online school an now I have to buy another one? I can understand if a laptop is 100 or so but really? I suppose I just ended up with a bad one.

Windows eight is  horrible, the computer  is slow,just haven't been happy with it! Wish I would have returned it! Going to donate the dumb thing and stick with apples iPad or Mac pro

WINDOWS 8 IS TOO HARD TO WORK WITH, I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS THE USER OR THE SYSTEM.

This laptop has two partitions that you cannot remove if you ever wish to restore your PC. The total amount held by the partitions is around 10GB, if something happens to these partitions you will not be able to install Office that comes with the PC, or worse restore your PC. If your HD goes bad you will have to pay Toshiba for your install, even if you have a Win 7 Home install CD Toshiba blocks the Key unless it is installed from their media. It drives me nuts that you buy a laptop, and then have to jump through Toshiba's hoops to keep using it as expected.Also the performance in high resource usage apps is terrible, far worse then a computer with these specs should be. Web surfing and Office work fine, but anything that puts a consistent load on it like photo-shop, or games with requirements well below what this laptop has causes this PC to sputter and heat up like an oven.  It must be a cooling issue, or cheap architecture, PC review sites have noted this issue as well. Don't say "Well this a laptop, not a gaming PC", the whole point of the upgraded AMD Vision is for 3d acceleration, but it's pretty much unusable and only adds an insane amount of heat.

After owning several problem-free Compaq and Dell laptops over the past 15 years, I made the mistake of buying my first Toshiba, a Satellite L675D. I admit that I was enthralled by the 17" display.  Big mistake. HUGE MISTAKE.  Less than four months after purchase, my wife opened the laptop one evening and the screen showed a crack in the upper right corner.  I sent the laptop to the Toshiba repair depot and they claim she accidently damaged it and they want $325 to repair it.  BTW, the entire system only cost $530 brand new.  According to Toshiba Customer Relations (and I quote) the "accident was caused by opening the case too hard".  I asked how that was even possible. Seriously, how do you open a laptop too hard? Toshiba said (and I quote), "you could have pulled too hard". If anyone from Toshiba is reading this, refer to T1-1174583 case # 110 331 001 320.  I swear these are exact quotes.  I currently own several Toshiba products, but after this experience I will never purchase another Toshiba product of any type in my lifetime. And now whenever I see someone even looking at a Toshiba laptop in Best Buy, HHGreg, WalMart, etc, I will warn them not to even consider Toshiba. Stick with manufacturers who stand behind their products. Toshiba is not one of them.

I purchased this laptop thinking that this would be a good deal for the price as I didn't want to use it for much more than browsing the web and playing 1 facebook game. I got this computer and started it up and did all the necessary stuff I needed too. I hardly put anything on the computer except a few songs and pictures but nothing other than that. So I go to play my facebook game and it is just running sooooo slow. I even had the thing freeze on me and had to end the task via task manager. I also noticed that my cpu usage is at 60% and my memory usage is around 56% and I had nothing running but task manager. I did everything without removing important stuff and I still can't get it to not freeze when I play a single facebook game. My old laptop is 6 years old, and it runs 10xs faster(ABSOLUTELY no lie). It's definitely defective and I am sending it back immediately. This product doesn't work at all for ANYTHING other than surfing the web, and depending on where you go, it's slow too. Just wish there was a decent performing laptop I could get that didn't fail on me all the time. Good riddance!!

The laptop has worked well for me, but has has a design flaw in the hinges.  The monitor hinge has failed 2 times and I have had to wait 1 month each time while the unit was at HP for repair.  The third time the piece of plastic that the base of the hinge attaches to separated from the rest of the computer.  The hinge does not directly connect into the chassis, but is connected only to a 2"X2" piece of plastic that is held in place only by plastic tabs.  HP offers no option but at third repair trip.I would return this unit if possible because of the hinge issue.

Laptop upon setup displayed the following error: HP SETUP NOT RESPONDING....  I have no time nor desire to deal with a DOA product from HP.

I was really excited to buy this laptop because I needed a small laptop to bring to lectures.  The size is perfect, however, the performance of this laptop was VERY slow and laggy!  I was also surprised at how much it overheated.  Needless to say, I was not very impressed with this laptop and it will be returned.

My wife and I have two HP DM1 computers. They were very good when they were new. We liked how small and light and easy to pack they were. Unfortunately, by the time they were a year old, they were so slow that they were unusable. I suspect that they were overheating but cooling pads did not help much. Anyway, I don't recommend these computers. You pay extra for their small size and they have just enough capacity when they are brand new. When they get a little older they don't have enough capacity.

Windows 8 is a horrible operating system designed for touch screens! I don't know how well it works on touch screens but it doesn't work here. The 8.1 made it a little bit more user friendly but.. I don't know if it's windows or the sensitivity of this mouse pad but unwanted windows keep popping up everywhere even after I turned off the corners.I constantly have to go to task manager just to get things turned off completely. Why? Why? Why? I choose this because I'm mainly looking for something to write with and heard the keyboards on the Lenovo are the best. Think again. First off the edges are so sharp it scrapes against your wrists or forearms depending on whether your typing on the couch, in bed, or at a desk. The quality of the camera and audio for 2014 is ridiculous even compared to my 9 year old HP and not even worthy of record a simple song which is the only other thing I like to use my lap top for. Beleive me my iphone 4 does a better job at that and my HP was beautiful.. To top it off, today number keys 5 & 6 (yes I'm typing this from my iMac) Quit working all together. Number Pad and Numbers across the top. It's a complete waste of money. if Amazon took stuff back for dissatisfaction I would return it in an instant. As it is I'm sure I'll need something to replace it within six months. Horrible. Worst purchase ever!

This laptop had very little wear. I would take it from my home to a coffee shop every once in a while. But after about 60 days of having this laptop, the screen goes blank. It's still backlit so I know its not broken but after the start-up screen, it just goes to black. I could boot it into safe mode and get to the desk top, so I knew it must of been a driver. Because it was fairly new and I didn't have any extremely important files on it, I booted it into safe mode and did a system wipe to get it back to the way it was out of the box. But on start up it gets stuck in a loop saying that it needs to install windows. (It didn't come with a Windows 8 CD) So I call Lenovo and they say to use the One-touch Recovery System.  I did that and now the laptop boots up. But it would be a lie to say it's "working"  because nothing works. It's unbelievably slow.  I'll click a button and nothing will happen to 5 minutes.  Any program that I do get to work  will give me a "Not responding" message after after about 2 minutes. Its worthless.  Here's the thing. I do freelance video work in and I used this laptop to visit clients and pick up files off their external hard drives (that fact that it has USB 3.0 plugs is one of the reasons I bought it)  It was nice because they would bring their hard drive, I would get the files and then we could review them on the laptop. I would take the files home and transfer them to one of my hard drives. But now I can't do that. And I actually lost a bid because the person said they only had a hard drive and I would need a laptop to pic up the files. I could just get another one but $300 is huge to somebody just starting out.The whole situation is unbelievably frustrating. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this laptop. I bought it because I had always hear good things from Lenovo and I thought it was a good deal. It's not. You can spend an extra $50 a get a better computer.  I get asked a lot about technology from friends and family and I can honestly say that I will never recommend a Lenovo product to anybody. Ever.

This computer was bought for my daughter. It took 20 minutes to load a web page or any other function. It had trouble recognizing Wi-Fi signals. Kept bouncing to different screens between desktop, Windows 8 screen, and whatever she was trying to work on.I returned this computer and got her an HP!

This was a good buy for the money, computer met all of my expectations.  I really liked the keyboard with the number keys on the side.

I bought 2 of these laptops for my children for Christmas. They have horrible performance. They are slow and you can forget reliable streaming.  The streaming is useless even when an entire video is buffered. I thought I was getting a deal but boy was I wrong!

Wifi drops all the time and has to be reset....No fix can be found, check out the forums before you buy from Lenovo Tons of models have the same problem :(

Just wanted to use this for searching the web and storing photos. What a disaster. This loads the internet slowly, and storing and sharing photos is just frightening hard. You have to use Google store for apps and the selection is poor. Steer clear of this computer if you are used to a simple, fast machine--you will be greatly disappointed.

The most impressive feature of my machine is it's remarkable "hang time" waiting for the system to respond.  Just clicking in the search box to type something in may take a full minute to even get a cursor.  Then it's a few letters at a time.  Ironically, this is the most I have been able to type on this machine without a wait.  The Chrome hangs and crashes over and over.  I can't even use it efficiently to read Facebook as it hangs when i try to scroll the page.  Trying to work between sites like Facebook to Pinterest to Twitter is the stuff nightmares are made of.  Searched online for ways to speed it up.  Even reset it to factory defaults.  Can't load anything on it, so it's not a power-sucking app somewhere.  How can I get rid of this thing?

I bought this for xmas for my son who is going off to college and it worked for a couple of months and then the speakers stopped working. I cannot return it either. Not worth the money if it is going to start having issues after a couple of months.

I was at BestBuy and saw it.  I tried it and liked it.  Since BestBuy was out of stock.  I bought through Amazon.  First of all, it was supposedly a prime shipping that I should receive it in two days since it was available.  NO! it took more than 1 week to arrive.  After it arrived, I was anxious to use it.  It was not too difficult to get is online to use. Since I intended to use it during my business trip, I wanted to install Skype.  NOOOO... Google will not work with Microsoft to allow Skype to be installed on Google's Chromebook 14.  I returned this machine.  The return process from Amazon was smooth and friendly.  But the company did not process refund until I wrote a comment and gave the receiver's name and time to receive.  After this email, I got an email to tell me that their refund process allow certain numbers of days to process the paperwork.  But, fortunately, I did receive the refund a day later.

The unit I received has no SIM card slot! Misleading images on the webpage! Waste of my time in waiting and returning this order! That's the main reason I got this model in the first place!

I was really excited about getting a new computer. I loved the color and the style of the chromebook. Something I did not do before I purchased it, I did not read the reviews. Seemingly, I should have read more into the product. Everything is ran off of internet. EVERYTHING. There is no microsoft windows or anything. When I realized everything ran on internet, I did not like that fact. There is no actually storage, it's all cloud storage which doesn't seem that safe to me. If you were a college student on campus and used a lot of internet or had constant access, it would be great. But I don't have internet all the time.

We bought this for 15 year old grand daughter. Operating system was difficult to understand. Wouldn't keep charge. We returned it.

Google.  If you have any other search engine forget it.  They have this set so it was impossible for me to operate with yahoo.

It's not user friendly.  No office programs can be run on it, and Google docs and all those programs are no where close to being as good as Microsoft office.  There isn't a start menu and nothing can be saved to the desktop.  Photos are uploaded to a Google+ account and not even saved to the computer itself.  You can't use iTunes.  The only positive is probably the battery life.  If you need to do anything on a computer besides browse the internet then I would say don't buy it unless Google decides to allow Microsoft Office programs to run on its system.

I read the customer reviews on this laptop and thought it would be perfect for my daughter.  She is a college student and the reviews said that it would be good for a student.  Let me start off by saying that I know very little about computers. I thought all computers had Windows. This laptop does not have Windows. So she could not write a paper and then email it to the professor. How could he/she pull it up? Its program is not compatible with Windows which is what most people have. She also couldn't store her itunes music on her laptop.  Itunes is also not compatible with this computer.  So we had to return it. This laptop was not for us!HOWEVER! Let me tell you how AWESOME Amazon was at handling my refund & return. The customer service person was understanding and helpful. She refunded the money right away and then emailed me a return slip.  I took the package to UPS and they returned it for FREE! I received an email letting me know that they had refunded my money and that they had received the package.  I love that Amazon has awesome customer service and I WILL keep shopping with them!

I am a very knowlegable computer user. This computer is by far the worst purchase I have ever made. It very confusing, in many ways. For example, it took me an hour to figure out how to get help in finding the "cap' on/off button. You actually have to go into settings, and change one of your shift keys in order to make it act as your capital key. Honestly, the most simplistic things "everyone" knows how to use, has been made unfathomably difficult. I still can not get the volume to work other then with head phones. This is absolutely the most frustrating computer I have ever owned. I cannot wait to send it back tomorrow. I have spent days trying to figure things out. Please don't purchase, it looks cute but it is a horrible purchase, and not worth even the cheapest of price.

DON"T GET THIS!! i got this and it exploded and it summoned the purple cows from Jupiter!! I want my money back!!

another bad android product that is constanly pushing more and more google products down your throat. good luck trying to use this for anything useful. dont waste your money, just buy a laptop or pc

I recieved this with much anticipation.  I had done a lot of research and benchmark research.  This pc has the specs but not the performance.  I believe there to be an internal voltage problem.  Anytime this laptop is plugged in frame rates drop performance falls on its face and all cores clock down ( and yes energy management settings are proper.)  Yet when it is on just battery power it performs as it should.  I know this does not make any sense.  I have spent countless hours on the phone with lenovo. i continue to get bounced around and lots of time on remote desktop reinstalling drivers time and time again.  this has been an absolute nightmare with way to much time invested.  If i can not get this thing returned or repaired i will surely take a loss selling it and go back to samsung again, which by the way i have a series 3 with a6-3410mx and slower ram that benchmarks much lower but has the same frame rates in games.  and runs its advertised clocks.  If anyone else finds this problem or a way to remedy it let me know and i will change my review.  I recently purchased my first two lenovos and quite possibly my last,

This tablet/ laptop thing is horrible. I know a lot of my issues have to do with Windows 8 (which I also hate) but this thing constantly updates. If you turn it on, it updates. If you are working, it updates. You can be doing one task and then it will switch to something else and then you have to figure out how to get back to where you were. When using it as a tablet it is ok. However, the touch screen has to be constantly cleaned because it won't respond correctly with fingerprints. When the keyboard is attached (which I need to work) it is very top heavy. Don't think of letting it go because it will fall over. Even typing this now, I have to have pressure on the keyboard so it doesn't fall off my lap into the floor. So in all, I hate it. It might be good for a kid playing games but for my work, it is terrible. HP has been disappointing in the last year.

I am very familiar with laptops but this one was very hard to work with and navigate with.  It was not cooperative with switching from touch screen to key pad.  It seemed heavier than I thought it would be.

Very slow. Firefox and Explorer lagged after updates are installed. Even slower with McAfee loaded  Detachable feature is nice but tablet can't be charged without the base keyboard. 64GB hard drive is too small. I am still trying to figure out how to open the unit to upgrade RAM and hard drive.

Somehow painfully slow despite the specs being significantly higher than my last lap top. The touch screen is incredibly laggy and unresponsive, often actions must be repeated 2-4 times. The stylus is much better, but no picnic either. The fingerprint reader is a joke. The screen is encased in flimsy plastic, the whole thing feels cheap. Webcam is terrible. Computer will often get stuck when put to sleep, or closed. I have lost more work than I care to remember. It's also might ugly... I regret not sending the computer back immediately, don't know what I was thinking.

I had my sister bought this unit several months ago through Amazon, up to now it is still not working right.  The tablet is not working and I have been trying to get in touch with HP but they have not responded to date.  The unit is with me now in the Philippines and it seems its not going to function as a tablet but a regular PC.  Its also too slow for me.  I have had several computers and its supposed to be a back up for my Dell XPS.  I am still waiting for HP to reply to my queries.  Beware do not buy this computer specially if you are bringing it outside the US Mainland.  Its the lousiest computer I have ever used.

I bought the 2008 and 2009 version of this laptop.  I've been forced to replace them after less than two years of use.  Very disappointed in their longevity.

The worst laptop I ever owned.sent it back to Sony because it froze on me.Not to mention the 4 other times I called tech service on the phone for hours.My son had important docs. that he lost because the laptop had internal issues.I would not recommend this vio fit.

I bought an S431 from another Amazon vendor and it arrived with a defective 22GB SSD used for the Intel Rapid Storage Technology. An opened computer cannot be returned you must use the manufacturer's warranty process. A replacement chip was sent by Lenovo but it was not partitioned with the required "hibernation" partition needed for the Intel RST. Also, since the recovery disks are made from the data on this SSD drive from the factory I would not trust them to be accurate. I sent it to the Lenovo repair center, at least 3 techs looked at it (each time you call for information they "escalate the problem to engineering" which is doublespeak for it goes to another tech). It was sent back worse than when I gave it to them, both the HDD and SSD were partitioned much different than factory settings and nop "Hibernation" partition at all. They dodged the issue by running a complete automated hardware test and told me it is fixed. Their techs have no clue or ability on how to partition the SSD properly, I have no recovery disks, I don't have the machine I paid for.I will never touch a Lenovo product again.

Customers service is a crapI bought this laptop few months ago,and i think it was the worst decision that i had made in my life,the screen get cracked spontaneously, and Sony refused to repair it.they have the worst customer service.i am not gonna buy any Sony product again.

I read all the good reviews about the HP Probook 4525s and purchased one.  The Probook worked great for two hours and then became extremely hot and then shut down.  The laptop would not turn back on again.  I returned the Probook the same day that I received it.  I was certainly disappointed and perhaps it was just one lemon.  I do wonder if this is a common problem with this model.

HP laptop build quality is very poor. I have had two dv-4 laptops (similar to this model) that have died due to related problems, after less than two years. The screen attachment mechanism is not strong, and fails after repeated use. My daughter's computer cracked at the hinge after only a year, and my son's laptop had the video disappear a few days ago, with similar looseness in the hinge area. The computers were bought for Christmas, 2009, less than two years ago. I can't speak for current DELL quality, but I have a 6-year-old Inspiron laptop that's still working fine, and a 7-year-old Latitude that is also still plugging away on Windows 2000 -- so HP has no excuse for such dismal performance. HP support offered me a $100 discount on a new laptop when I called, but I expect more than two years of life from these products, and won't be buying another laptop from them. Just some info for your consideration...  - Don

Anyone who buys an HP computer is making a serious mistake.  Having purchased several HP laptops that died within months of each other, I can testify that they are made of the lowest quality components, poorly assembled and poorly designed.  You will experience overheating, mechanical failure, and other defects.  The worst is that HP does not stand behind its products and treats its customers like the suckers that we apparently are by being fooled into buying their products.

I thougt the low price and the fact that it had Windows 7 made it worth the risk of buying. Never again.  With this computer, I have to be very careful when typing a message, even as I'm doing now, because the cursor jumps around to another spot in the message. And frequently, I mean very frequently, I had to troubleshoot to get it to connect to the internet when other wifi devices in the house worked just fine.  Annoying. Also no number keys pad, but I could have lived with that.  I rarely write negative reviews, but this was a very poor choice on my part.  I'm going to save up and get a good one next time.Update: The company has been very prompt in responding, and has said they would accept a return with a restocking fee (which is perfectly understandable since I'm sure they have to go into the computer to make sure you have deleted all your personal stuff, etc.).  So the company seems wonderful, but not this particular laptop.

Would not see the hard drive after 7 days. After spending an entire day doing repeated Windows updates, then by the next weekend it would not start.

I believe this machine was refurbished.  There were over 1,000 viruses and ad attachments when I got the machine. The machine kept turning off.  The webcam worked sometimes.  It was a frustrating experience.  I thank Amazon for quickly refunding my money.

Guaranteed for 90 days.  Purchased July 10 and died October 11.  Like the computer knew exactly when 90 days were up,As I read the morning news on AOL, I heard a loud shrill noise coming from computer and everything froze - solid.  Unable to clear it.  Took it to an expert this a.m. - he asked about recovery disk which I thought had been sent but not so - the disk was something else.  Dell now wants to charge $50 for recovery disk (and Dell has back orders for the disk) - and expert will charge me $150  to fix.  I am not happy or amused.  Any yes, I had backup and antivirus and etc,etc. and nothing worked like it should.So here I sit with my 7 year old, slow but working Sony Vaio that is still plugging along.

I bought this computer about two month ago, and  several weeks ago, it suddenly turned off without warnings. This prevented me doing anything with this computer.I contacted the customer's office and they granted me right to return this item since it is indeed the dysfunction of this computer and also the fact that I have never returned any products since the beginning. The reason I did give this rate is first this computer I bought indeed is bad. Further the seller charged me the 20% restock fee!?

In August 2013, I reviewed this product and rated it 4 stars, based on what seemed to be adequate performance but I have now completely changed my mind and rating based on current events. We purchased this unit for our daughter, who is a kindergarten teacher. It was delivered on May 09, 2012 and in August 2013, 1.25 years later, it seemed to be performing as expected. BUT, on May 09, 2014, exactly 2 years after delivery, our daughter called and advised that the unit had completely died and according to a preliminary investigation, the processor and/or motherboard had failed. I contacted Amazon, strictly to advise them of the problem. But, realizing that the product is beyond its short 1-year warranty, I was certainly not expecting a replacement but was simply seeking assistance and Amazon has provided that, thus far. I contacted Dell and ultimately encountered one of the most convoluted runarounds in which I have ever been involved. I spoke to a Tech Support rep, who needed certain identifying product information, so I had to agree to call back. When I did, I attempted reach Customer Support but thanks to Dell's "wonderful" automated phone system, I ended up with Tech Support. After realizing that the unit was out of warranty, that rep couldn't get me off of the phone fast enough. As though he was reading from a script, in very broken English, he was attempting to explain the principle of a warranty to me. I, in turn, explained that as a 20-year employee of Panasonic Co., I well understood both warranties and product quality and my point was not whether or not the product was in warranty but was whether it was reasonable to expect it to completely fail in two years. He just didn't understand!! Finally, I asked to be transferred to Customer Support. I was on "Hold" for 8 minutes before being cut off. I called back and after winding my way through Dell's maze-like phone system, I reached that department. As soon as that rep, who also spoke broken English, realized that the warranty had expired, she transferred me to Tech Support as I was in the middle of a sentence, again attempting to explain my problem with having a product fail in two short years. But, disappointingly, I again ended up with Tech Support, In one last desperate attempt, I futilely tried to explain my problem to a different representative but he, too, in broken English, seemed to read from a script in explaining that the product was out of warranty and nothing could be done. So, on May 10, 2014, I wrote a letter to Michael S. Dell, President and CEO of Dell. Certainly this American could understand the point that I was attempting to make! But, on May 15, 2014, I received a call from a man, purporting to be from the executive offices and responding to my May 10 letter, to Mr. Dell. I did not understand his name, however, since he, too, spoke in broken English! After some discussion, he stated that based on the "alarm code" given off by the Laptop, his assessment is that the Processor has failed and according to his explanation, because of the cost, there is nothing that Dell can (will??) do. He then rather insultingly attempted to explain the term "warranty" to me but I stopped him, explaining my history with Panasonic. He then made a statement that I will not forget. He said that it is because of what has happened here, that Dell extends warranties instead of guaranties. I took this as evidence of how much confidence Dell has in its products and how little attention it pays to quality. I told him that because of this instance, and despite the fact that I have purchased several Dell products over the years, I will never purchase a Dell product again. He couldn't have cared less, in my opinion, and said that he would take my comment as "feedback"!! I will now find a computer manufacturer that at least understands the American way of doing business but I am definitely finished with Dell. If I could have scored this purchase a "0", I would have...

This is the most awful laptop i ever had.its not even 2 months its filled with virus and gets stuck every minute.i have to close it by pressing power button becoz the shut down button is also stuck.the screen is bright and the picture is not good too.if you want to throw some cash its better if u throw it in ur garbage disposer than this laptop.

I used this computer for college work. I did not stress this system. It worked until last night when I was 1 page away from completing a paper! It froze and I had to manually power it down. It did not start backup. The power light and fan is on but the screen stays off. I am not impressed with this product. I realize that this is not the best computer, but it should be able to surf the web and run Microsoft Word.

The curser moves to different place while typing in Word, Excel, emails, etc which is my biggest complaint.  It is slow to boot up even without loading programs!  They put the USB ports towards the front but they block the cd tray so it is a struggling to work the cd tray.  Dell told me it would work for 56k data transfer but it doesn't until I bought a modem that plugs into the USB and will send code thru my phone line to program access controls (that cord blocks cd tray now).  And they didn't put a groove to help pull the lid up.Oh, and when I called Dell to ask them for help choosing a computer, they tried to run my credit!  I found out when a letter arrived informing me & asking me to remove my credit freeze!  I bought online from Amazon & didn't need credit.  Dell didn't care about my complaint when I called them back!!!  Scammers.

Lasted about a month then a white line appeared about half way up the screen. If you push on the screen the line will go away as long as you push it. When you take your hand off screen the line comes back... this is junk, do not buy...!

I have owned several Dell lap tops through the years.  First time purchasing a computer on line.  Opened the box, plugged it in, NOTHING. Pitch black.  Tried again, NOTHING.  Huge bummer.  Called Dell help line, they suggested a simple solution.  NOTHING.  They suggested I send it in and they would look at it.  NO THANKS DELL.  I returned the computer for a full refund minus the cost of sending it back.  Never again!  "Penny wise and dollar foolish".  In the future, I want to touch it and see if it works to my liking before buying.  I suggest you do the same.

THE COMPUTER HAS STOPPED WORKING ALREADY AND I CANT FIND THE RECEIPT TO CALL ABOUT IT. NOT SURE WHAT I SHOULD DO ABOUT IT.

Computer was in good physical condition. Description was accurate of features.  Loaded very slowly and sluggish response to commands.  First virus scan found over a thousand errors!  Seller should have to pay for anti virus software I had to download to clean it up!

Hard drive on this laptop crashed within a few months of very light use. Recovery disks would not work so sent it to Gateway for warranty service. I had to pay shipping $25.85 without insurance (big mistake). They claimed I sent it in with the case broken and since I would not pay $210.94 to fix the broken corner they would not repair the hard drive. They sent a picture of the box and there is no visible damage on the box. It was packaged very well with the PC in the middle surrounded by tons of bubble wrap and air bags. I thought they were mixing up customer orders. They made it clear it was my laptop and they would not cover anything unless I paid the $210.94. They also told me they receive 1000, yes one thousand, computers back for service every day. At this point I was raging and told them to send it back to me. THEN I'm told if they send it back I cannot claim the $100 UPS allows for damaged merchandise that was not insured. I thought I was in the Twilight Zone - these people are out and out liars and thieves!!!I did some research for complaints against Gateway and this same scenario has played out many times over. Acer seems to be the owners of Gateway for whatever that's worth. I tried going to WalMart where the purchase was made but they refused to accept any responsibility for the merchandise they carry. So the end user....me, is out $400 and left without a computer. It's a sad day when large corporations get away with tactics like what I experienced. Suffice that I WILL NEVER own another Gateway and WILL NEVER purchase another PC from WalMart. Shame on both of them.BUYER BEWARE - when a company has no skin in the game it's easy to avoid responsibility.Here's someone else's story: [...]He even paid Gateway $21.25 for their recovery disks which didn't work - OF COURSE THEY DIDN'TUPDATE 7/2/13We tried returning the laptop to our local WalMart. They said they could not take it back that we should return it to the store where it was purchased. We made the 600 mile trip (as part of a vacation) and I'm happy to report that this WalMart did take the computer back and gave us a full refund. Goes to show who believes in their customer base and that GateWay could NOT care less. THANK YOU WALMART.

After several months Notebook began blue screening. Called Gateway/Acer for support and they were very reluctant to help. They told us to reboot it to inital config (default). This did not fix issue. Sent the unit back for repair - not sure what they did - still blue screens. After going through this the warranty has passed - tech support said we had insufficient Anti-virus which is BS. They want my company to buy extended warranty to fix. I'm in IT and thier tech support is horrible, not to mention having to but coverage after the fact. I swill never purchase Gateway products for my company again.

This laptop could have been a great purchase... if it had been packaged properly. I bought it from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon (Secondipity) and it has been, by far, my worst Amazon purchase. I was so excited to get this computer, as my old one crashed a few weeks ago and I really need a laptop for school. So imagine my surprise and confusion when it arrives in an original Gateway box (instead of down inside a shipping box) without any bubblewrap or packing peanuts around it. At that point, I didn't really think anything of it because the laptop itself looked unscathed (wait for it). After I charged it for the required amount of time, I turned it on and the screen was completely white with a few colorful liness on the right side of the screen. It looked as if the hard drive was somehow damaged during shipping (surprise, surprise!) I immediately called Secondipity and their customer service line was down. Soo after a series of events too exhausting to list here, I was finally able to get the laptop sent back and I'm just waiting to get the money put back on my card. NEVER dealing with Secondipity again...

I wanted to buy my realtor husband a really cool father's day gift. One that would put him technically a cut above. I have been researching this type of new convertible type computer for quite some time and because of the reviews I took a chance and ordered this one. The graphics card does not support everything that he needs and worst of all be warned. Tech support for this product is priced at $90.00 per question! How outrageous and bizarre! We have purchased many computers in the past and this was going to be the coolest one yet. We were very excited about it. How unfortunate that, I'm sure, such a potentially cool product has NO TECH SUPPORT. No OK people beware.

The company that sold this to me said they would not tell me how much they would charge me for returning the computer unless I deleted my review saying that they were slow to respond to my return request.  They accused me of lying, trying to destroy their company, among other things.  I simple wanted to return a computer that I did not even touch.  Beware of this seller.The computer would not work for me, as I needed it for doing my office work while traveling.UpdateI removed my initial review in order to get a dollar amount if I returned the computer that was never touched. I heard back from the seller, long email like all the others, and I will lose basically 1/2 of what I spent on the computer if I send it back.Beware of this company. It is not professional. I would advice against buying anything from this company. I have never had this trouble before however in the future I will check out companies prior to a purchase.  The company name is Media & More.

This is a nice product purchased at BestBuy; they had the best prices.  Could not get it to connect to my ASUS dual band N router (56U) .  Considering I have 8 other devices connected  and a hour with Lenovo; we both figured it was a bad wireless card.  However, I took it back to BestBuy and they hooked right up to their network. I'm not buying a new router so I returned it.  There is a lot of network chatter on dual band routers and problems with the Yoga 13.  I wish I could of kept it.. Now I'm looking at the ASUS Transformer Book that is coming out. It has two drives, illuminate keyboard, front/rear camera and a slot for a network wire.

Just got a Yoga 13. Wifi didn't work out of the box. Tried fixing myself for hours. Other laptops in my house work just fine. The Yoga 13 sees our router but says limited connectivity and Win8 troubleshooter says "DNS server isn't responding." Called Lenovo support and was informed that if I wanted to get help for my brand new computer which is under warranty for another year it would cost me $179. They also kept asking my to hardwire to the internet, but obviously have no idea that their own product has no ethernet connection.  Thanks for nothing Lenovo, I have a very expensive paper weight.

Where do I start.When you boot the machine, everyday it has a different orientation. Their instructions for fixing or autorotate does not work. This Lenovo can pin on Microsoft but I wish I had waited for apple to come up with the touch screen feature to teach microsoft how it should be done in the first place.Next wifi - when older machines and $20 controls can see my wifi router, this dumb POS has to be positioned in all kinds of angles before it detects the signal. Heck I am standing right in front of the machine and it gives me a poor signal. Tech supports suggestion - change my router or internet service provider.Host of other issues. Next time, I will be buying a mac.

Personally this laptop wouldnt be as bad as its nor=w with lenovo.My hidge for this laptop broke so easily. Ideal having convertible itsellf is so poor.I called customer support and it asked me to send them via fedex. Once i send them laptop, i heard not even mail, or any word from them. Out of frustation i called thm and they said motherboard is dead due to water.God Damn there was never the case, it was hidge problem.They said they will return without repair, if  wasnt ready to pay 580$ repair cost for 45 day old laptop..i still called it back without repai and realized that laptop send back was actually worse conition than what it should be.HIGLY recommendation, never never buy lenovo.

Pros:  I don't know yet because I can't get past the wifi issues.Cons:  A laptop without wifi is a horrible desktop and since you need a dongle with this laptop that doesn't come with it, then that makes this laptop a really expensive paper weight.I have tried everything in the forums as well as in other reviews here and mine still won't connect.  I contacted Acer and they had me do a recover WITHOUT telling me that it would create a new install and put everything in the Windows.OLD folder, so now I get to redownload MS Office 2013 while tethered to my cell phone.  What a piece of junk.  I think this one is going back.  I'd rather spend an extra $20 for a Dell that will connect out of the box.

The only good thing I can say about this system is it has a nice keyboard.Turned it on for the first time and it sounded like a jet taking off the fan(s) were so loud.The fans were constantly running & the keyboard was getting quite warm.Day 2 it gave up the ghost. Network card fried. No ethernet, no WiFi.  I suspect that the unit over heated and fried the network card.Amazon sent two UPS pickups, both with different tracking numbers.  It did get picked up by the first guy who got there. The second guy kept trying for 3 days to do his pickup.  Amazon did credit my credit card with in a couple of days to their credit.I've had a Dell laptop before that is still going strong after 7 years.  This one was just poor design with the internals from the word go.I now have a similar system made by Toshiba with AMD dual core CPUs instead of the Intel Quad core CPU the Dell unit had.  The Toshiba was $75 cheaper at Walmart.  The system is just as fast, the fan hardly runs at all and it is whisper quiet.I would definitely not recommend a Dell product, this comes from some one who is retired after 30 years in the IT field doing just about everything.

Experienced a major defect in the screen display a few months after the purchase of the computer and computer was and still is under warranty.  Contacted Dell Warranty support (based in India) and sent them a picture of the display screen.  They stated that the problem was not a defect because defects occur within a day of use.  They refused to honor the warranty for which the computer was still covered by.  Tried to escalate but the last individual (name of Jabat Singh) refused to contact their superior and said that he would only give me the number for their out of warranty department. I have purchased a total of 5 Dell computers in the past 10 years and previous to this purchase had good experience with their customer support.  Obviously this is no longer the case and I will never purchase another Dell computer again.  For anyone looking to purchase a computer, I would definitely steer clear of the Dell brand.

No instructions!  very confusing operations. Can't find half of the stuff I have been using over the last 18 years.I hate Windows 8. Most of the 'F' keys are useless, and their function is changed. Changes should be for improvements. This is going in the WRONG direction! I wish I had never bought this computer. I could NEVER recommend this computer to anyone.I love the speed, and the screen size, but I can't do anything with it. Maybe play games...  I am currently using my old Toshiba, at least I can do something with that!

I bought mine at Best Buy and I have to say it's the worst laptop ever! 3 months after I got it, it started turning off by itself and getting really hot even if we cleaned its vents.We sent it to Lenovo company,BTW we had to pay for sending it, aprox. $45, and as soon as it got home we noticed that it was poorly assembled and every time we turned it on it would stay on a black screen and it said something about a cable not being connected, in white letters, then it would start working. A month later, it started acting up and sometimes it just freezes or it stays 'thinking' or 'loading' when you turn it on. We end up taking the battery out and putting it back in so it starts working. And the cd/dvd player stopped working and I'm sure it was because of how the company handled it when we sent it for them to 'repair' it!!! It still doesn't have a year with us, and this happened after just 3 months of buying it! Don't waste money on any computer by Lenovo, their service and support sucks!

I've had nothing but issues with this. Even when it WAS working, it was a subpar computer that can't handle Windows 8 very well.After 2 months of casually using it for work, it wouldn't load the operating system. The computer is nothing more than a paperweight and Lenovo support is worthless.

Unfortunately I didn't just purchase one if these, I got two, one for me and one for my daughter. Both of us hate this computer equally. I thought it would be a cheap way to get introduced to Windows 8. The most annoying thing about it is when you're trying to type e-mails etc, it jumps all over the place and suddenly you're typing in the middle of a line you already finished, so you have to delete it from the wrong line and reenter it in the correct place. Windows 8 was definitely made for touch screen which this computer definitely is not. Save yourself the money and annoyance and stay away from this product

I bought a U56E-BBL5 last year and the motherboard began to fail at about 13 months (unit kept randomly shutting itself off).  By 16 months, the motherboard rendered the laptop unusable. ASUS would not honor the repair even though the unit was just a few months out of warranty.  In my opinion, the motherboard was not manufactured to be a durable component and spoils the good features of the laptop since it is not usable without an expensive repair (around $400).  ASUS had an opportunity to practice good citizenship and take responsibility for the substandard component but chose not to.  I have seen a number of identical complaints involving some ASUS motherboards.

In March of 2012, I bought this ASUS laptop and after testing it out for a few weeks, left a 4-star review on here saying how light and functional it was, despite the terrible speakers (underneath the laptop, guys? Seriously?). After owning it for 11 months, I've deleted that review and I'm here to warn you: this is one of the most unreliable and absolutely pathetic excuses for a computer I've ever seen. It began a few months after I bought it when it started shutting off randomly on its own, which got worse and worse until I decided to send it into the manufacturer's for repairs. They replaced the hard drive, but the problem actually persisted. After ruling out the possibility of a virus, software conflict, overheating issue, overcharging the battery, this leads me to believe that the hard drive itself has a fault and all laptops of this brand are similarly faulty (especially going by many of the reviews on here). The official Asus live chat was also unable to troubleshoot it. Very, very disappointed. Will not buy Asus again, and I urge everyone else to do the same.

slower than it should be, terrible touch pad, poor screen resolution, and the worse speakers ever. Dont buy this comp i regret it.

I have an Asus U56E I5 processor 600 GB Hard drive and 6 GB ram.First my wireless stopped working. It would start fine and then just cut out. I have had to buy an external wireless card.  Then my computer started shutting off randomly if it was on battery. The battery would say that it was 80% full and then just shut off. It works great if you are always plugged in and have an Ethernet cable tho. Don't buy Asus.

This laptop (it would be my first--I've been desktop only) seemed to have everything I needed. It arrived, I set it up via the one sheet of paper that was the only documentation (no paper warranty included, and you'll see why this mattered in a moment).I live close to Google, who offer two WiFi sites, and there are six other local WiFi services, all with three or more connectivity bars. I knew that I could only access Lenovo's instruction guide and warranty if I got on line. Except that nothing I could do would connect it to any of the eight WiFi sources. I spent over an hour trying, and ended back, through the diagnostics, in the wonderful world of the 'recirculating loop' in which one chases one own tail and gets nowhere, merely returns to the diagnostics. (Note: I am not a computer neophyte and have been working with a series of machines starting with a Morrow (!) thirty years ago.)I called Lenovo customer support (long, complicated phone tree) and they confirmed my one-year warranty but could not help me. It was a software issue, they said, and connected me to the appropriate department. What a pity that the software is not warranted except at extra cost, on top of the purchase price.Decision: Lenovo laptop returned to Amazon.

Summary:1. Adapter stops working in the first year of purchase2. Touchpad wired with wrong material and stops working in the first year of purchase3. Permanent & annoying COntrol Panel Glitch4. Messed up audio circuitry freezes computer5. Transition from Windows XP to Windows 7 is painful. Windows 7 is crap.6. Dell's repair service plan is crap.Purchased this computer at the beginning of January 2010. Previously had a 3 year old Dell E1505 that worked perfectly. Thought I'd get the same quality three years later. Nope.The day I took it out of the box and tried to set it up, my Control Panel froze. Ever since then, I have always had this problem. The solution is to force the Control Panel close using the Task Manager, then reopen it. ANNOYING!In July, my adapter began malfunctioning. By August, it stopped working. Dell had to replace it. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ADAPTER LIGHT IS VEEERRY BRIGHT BLUE. Not always good for dorm room sleepers. You'll have to unplug your adapter every time to keep the light out of your eye.Yesterday the left and right click buttons below the touch pad stopped working. Both now go to auto scroll when I click on them. Googled solutions and found numerous customers complaining about a malfunctioning touchpad. Apparently Dell uses the wrong material to make the cable connection for the touchpad. Here is a thread about it, as well as a solution from a guy who Dell themselves thanked in the thread! [...]Still haven't gotten my click buttons to work. Dell told me that since I'm still under the warranty, they'd send me a box to mail in my laptop for repair. But I'd be without a laptop for 7 - 10 days at least, since they can't give me a replacement in the mean time!The other option would be for me to pay $59+tax for a Dell technician to come to my home to do the repair. Imagine that! And that mightn't even work!!!What is even more annoying is that the Control Panel never works when I pull it up the first time, so trying to deal with this click button problem is just more problematic because to simply access my settings is a big deal after restart.There is a big difference between Windows XP & Windows 7. Windows 7's user interface is deplorable. Trying to adjust settings in my problematic Control Panel yesterday to fix my click button problem was an absolute headache, because there is no Classic View in the Control Panel and if you're not familiar with the contents, you will find yourself clicking on every single heading in there just to find the one control that you want. MS Office 2007 is also drastically different from older versions. I constantly have to YouTube tutorials on how to do the simplest things in MS Word and Excel that used to be so easy to figure out in older versions of the software.Lastly (and I'm really hoping that it's 'lastly' and that my 8 month old computer doesn't come up with any MORE problems!!!), my audio circuitry seems to be messed up. I watch movies using external speakers to give me better sound than my laptop speakers. But whenever I'm watching a movie and I receive an instant message alert on Skype simultaneously, the sound reverts back to my laptop speakers, and the external speakers are automatically deactivated. Unplugging and replugging them doesn't to get the sound back to the external speakers. My movie freezes, followed by my entire computer, and I have to force shut down by holding the power button down for 10 secs. What is that about??? This happens every time that I receive a Skype message alert while watching a movie on my computer. The messed up audio circuitry freezes my computer. Now I have to remind myself to exit Skype before running a movie!I trusted Dell because of the positive experience that I had with my old computer. But this new Inspiron 1440 is making me never want to buy Dell again. I'm very frustrated with this "new" laptop and would just like to get my money back and buy a new computer. All the little problems have compounded to leave me with a very bitter taste in my mouth. Dell's quality has DETERIORATED over the years it seems. Unless I can get my problems fixed permanently and easily, I won't be buying from them again. I recommend that before you purchase this laptop, go google Inspiron 14 PROBLEMS, and see what comes up. You might see some recurring themes!!!

I've been a faithful Dell customer for at least 10 years and had been very happy until this machine.Whatever Dell you buy, make sure the wireless card is not a Dell Wireless 1703. Search the internet for Inspiron 15 dropping wireless signal and you'll see that this an issue experienced by many. The rest of the machine is okay. I'd give it 3/5 stars. But given this wireless card problem and the length of time I've spent with tech support so far, I wish I could give it a 0/5 stars. It wouldn't be a problem if Dell would admit there's an issue but they're very resistant to do so.Mine has had issues dropping the wireless signal since I bought it. Because it is an intermittent problem, you will get a lot of resistance from tech support.Over the course of 3-4 months, multiple calls and chat sessions with tech support, I've been instructed to update the drivers, they've updated the drivers, they fussed with settings, rebootings, BIOS updates, and they came to the conclusion that it was my router (despite telling them no other device I have has had problems). AT&T; replaced the router even though they found no issue with it. Not ten minutes after the AT&T; tech left, my computer dropped the signal.Today Dell finally decided to replace the wireless card. Yes, it took nearly the length of the software warranty for them to finally decide that there is indeed an issue!If you already have this machine and finally reached the point where Dell decides to replace the card, ask them to replace it with a different type. They seem to be okay with this. I'll come back and update this if they try and give me the same type of card and/or if the new card hasn't fixed this.As for the rest of the machine:The mouse is a little inaccurate. You have to focus tap-to-clicks on the far left of the mouse or else it won't pick it up as a tap. It's annoying.The battery life leaves something to be desired. I get 2-3 hours with the power usage being almost at it's minimum.The rest of the machine is fine for what it is. This is a low end laptop so it's no hard core gaming computer.As far as Windows 8 goes:Windows 8 can be tolerable with the start button modification. Windows 8 is widely known as a giant flop but if you're like me and use computers for work and can't limp your Windows 7 machine any longer, you'll have to learn to put up with it. That's a problem with Microsoft though and not the machine.My biggest complaint is the wireless card and how long it has taken for Dell to admit mine is faulty despite the fact that many, many customers are having the same problem. Prior to this, I had always been pleased with Dell computers and their support. My experience with this machine and with Windows 8 has me pricing Apple computers. The amount of wages I've lost because of time spent on this an unable to work is much more than what an Apple would have cost.

This is not a good laptop! It is very slow. It seems that something wrong with it because it shouldn't be so slow.  Also the screen is bad- eyes are tired after short time looking at it. It is also very heavy.

I was not informed that a returned computer would be charged 20% off the original price even if the computer was in perfect condition. Also the shipping was free to me but the seller charged 20%+$14. to take the computer back. I paid $390.98 for the computer and received credit for $298.40.!!!!

My real problem with this computer is the Windows 8 installed on it. I have spent a couple of months trying to get used to this ridiculous operating system. I will never purchase a PC again. My productivity has dropped and I never even want to log on to this computer. The app functionality doesn't work properly unless you have a touch screen and I can't even figure out how to do basic things like minimize windows. I hate windows 8.

I bought it as a gift for my wife and she only used for  days and now, it doesnt even turn on. It is horrible

lapto buy this black Friday Christmas gift for my wife and came to Venezuela in Latin America 30 days, the first day to use the battery in less than 3 hours, the second day would not start was downloaded, not loading and does nothing! ! lost 370 dollars on a computer even step quality control as I get my hands with fatal flaw, as I do to fix this serious problem??

Touch Pad  gives lot of hard sound,very irritating. I have now decided always buy  good models regardless of the price,never go for cheap deals, they have low priced items installed in them.

i bought this computer five months ago. everything seemed to work fine. however the screen went white. because I bought it online and it was an older model asus will not honor the year warranty it came with. buyer beware asus will not accept any form of purchase proof to honor their warranty.

I spent almost two hours on the phone with ASUS technical support.  The Ineternet Explorer browser would not let me go to any websites or downloand any software from the Internet.  I wanted to download Google Chrome but the IE browser would not let me - would block me from doing so.  Very frustrating.  Tech support didn't know how to fix it and told me I have to send it back.  Very disappointing.

Dell has a serious flaw in the design of this and their newer laptops/notebooks. They are making computers thinner and lighter which ends up restricting the airflow. This causes internal parts to overheat. The typical result in my computer is that the graphics card will overheat and cause the system to lock up.I have this Dell Studio 15" with factory upgraded ram and other goodies totaling about $1000 investment. Since the new box arrived at my door a year ago, it has continually crashed and locked-up. Dell support has tried everything under the sun, short of giving me a new computer. This includes sending techs to my house and replacing internal parts like the graphics card, motherboard, etc. Alas, nothing changes. The fan always runs at full throttle within moments of start-up. If I try to watch a video or even if a web-page has anything using flash, immediately graphics card failure occurs resulting an over-sized cursor and a total system lock-up. My only option is to do a hard system shutdown. Disabling flash or other scripts only delays the inevitable.I have owned several Dells in the past and WAS a huge fan of Dell; however, this experience has left me very frustrated and disappointed. One tech advised me to purchase a Toshiba as they are not having this issue because their laptops are still a little bulkier providing better airflow.

The Dell Studio was provided to me by Dell Tech Support as a replacement computer, for another Dell Studio.  The original Dell Studio continuously overheated and the left side plastic hinge and monitor frame broke.  Unfortunately, the new one didn't overheat, but the left side hinge and frame broke again.  The first and second time, the computer was covered under an extended warranty.  However, it broke for a third time now, and it's off warranty.  My wife and I have been careful and conscientious with this computer, and it keeps breaking.Now, there's also a power issue with the laptop - you can only use it after putting it in sleep mode.  If you do a total shutdown or a restart, you have to reboot it a half dozen times to get a video display.NEVER AGAIN.  DO NOT BUY A STUDIO 1555.

Dell studio 1555, purchased in 2009 for 650 dollars, 9-cell battery, maxed the ram.I hoped I am purchasing a good solid machine for 3 years to last. Did not.Within 6 months the HD failed. Lost data during final exam. It was hell.Screen developed vertical lines. Need new screen.All of a sudden, stopped turning on.I have an extended warranty, and under this "warranty" they asked me 400 (four hundred) for the repair!!!Needed a computer, bought a new Toshiba for the same money.I took DELL apart and found 2 broken wires. They connect the blink-blink power-on button to the MB. Every time you open the laptop these wires twist and finally break. This problem never happened with older computers. Dell invented a new way to fail the laptop. You pay the price for the flashy blink-blink button.I found a new power-on button for 4 dollars on the ebay! This fixed the 400 dollar repair under the "extended warranty" plan. A new screen can be bought for about 60. Set of hinges - 5 dollars. Dell is not what it used to be. Sorry.Did anyone notice, that DELL logo and Enron logo look the same? CROOKED "E".

I purchased this system in Hong Kong, planning to bring it the US for College. I also bought a 3-year international warranty for about US$50. The computer worked fine for one year, and then hell broke loose. First the battery refuses to hold a charge. If I plug in the computer overnight, the charge would still hold for only 50 minutes. Then the LED screen refuses to lit up when opened. I have to open and shut it for ten times before it finally registers that the screen is propped up. Lately the computer is also making loud, scratchy noises. I have tried to contact Dell to redeem my supposedly international warranty, but the database of Hong Kong and the US are not connected. You have to manually request to transfer your service tag to another country. I have tried three times doing that, and every time Dell emailed me back and say that my information cannot be verified. It doesn't help that each 'transfer' takes up to 22 days. I have concluded that Dell is not interested in honoring its warranty. Will never buy Dell again.

do not buy it!!!! it looks great, and probably would have worked great, had Dell not released this product before they fixed all the glitches. it is a disaster, and don't bother trying to "fix" or get a replacement. it is a dead end street with Dell.  the computer over heats and shuts off constantly. i have done a Google search (after i bought it! big mistake) and learned that this model being a lemon was a known fact in the tech world. there are literally hundreds of complaints on Dell's own customer boards. read them before you make a decision!! no more Dell for me- ever!

Update: 5/29/13 - HP will not help me get this broken laptop replaced in time for the business trip that I bought it for.  Even though it was already sent in for repair (under warranty) and they were unable to repair it, they are telling me that they have to try to repair it two more times before they can give me a replacement.  It's been a month without a laptop now and I need it for my trip, so I had no choice but to purchase ANOTHER laptop just 5 months after spending $1300 on this one.  I purchased a Samsung Series 7 and couldn't be happier with it so far.  Sharper screen (even though they are both 1080p), HOURS more battery life, USB 3.0 ports that actually work as USB 3.0 ports without having to search for strange drivers that I never actually found, much more accurate color out of the box, less fan noise, and an amazing trackpad that does not register my palm and move the cursor every time I type a sentence.  Most of all, it's not broken as this HP Spectre STILL is.  Go with a Samsung or Sony, or switch to Mac... HP is only pretending to sell high-end devices that they can't back up with the customer service a high-end consumer device deserves.  Full story of my problems are below in my last update:It's 5/24/13 and I've been trying to get this laptop fixed for weeks.  My laptop is a total lemon.4 months after purchasing this laptop for my work in photography and filmmaking, the screen began to go absolutely haywire.  It flickers, flashes, then gets stuck on screens of random lines and colors.  I'd barely used the laptop prior to this starting, as I own much more powerful PCs at home.  This is basically my business trip machine and I've only had to use it on one trip.  From my experience, it looks as if the graphics card is fried, however it works fine when attached to an external monitor, which leads me to believe that there is faulty wiring going to the display.2 weeks ago I began the warranty process with HP, sent the laptop to them for repair.  It came back with the note that all they did was reinstall Windows.  Now, with a fresh Windows install it is still unusable... absolutely nothing has changed.  Even before I installed a single program.  This is, and always was, a problem with the hardware.I called HP support again and they started a new warranty repair, but I am going on the exact business trip that I bought this laptop for next Sunday.  I will not even get the label to ship it to them until Tuesday.  They would get it Wednesday.  Then they'd have to ship it back, fixed, Thursday for me to get the laptop back in time.  Considering it took them 5 business days to reinstall Windows the last service call, I seriously doubt they will repair a hardware problem in one day.I'm at a loss of what to do at this point.  I was escalated to HP Corporate on the phone today and explained my situation.  I've been entirely polite, as I find that to be the best way to get things resolved with customer service.  I asked to ship the computer to them myself, today, without their label to make this go faster and they can't let me do that.  I asked for a loaner laptop while it is getting fixed and they can't do that.  I asked for an exchange for a refurbished unit and they can't do that.  I feel I am being completely reasonable here for a $1300 laptop that hasn't even survived 4 months of light use.  I bought this mostly for video editing on the road, but had not even done any video editing on it yet, so I am definitely not pushing the system yet.  I'm not asking for a refund, I'm just asking for my SECOND repair in a row to come with a loaner that I can use on my business trip!  I mean, it's been 19 days now without a laptop and we're just now starting the whole repair process over again.Corporate told me that they could send me a loaner if I had purchased a business laptop.  That basically they don't care that I need this laptop for business because it's a consumer laptop.  The problem is, I did plenty of research before purchasing this laptop and, at the time, they did not offer business laptops with 1080p IPS monitors, something I absolutely need so that I can color calibrate the screen and work on 1080p video.  This laptop has professional specs (that outclass their business machines) and a professional price (that is more expensive than most of their business machines) but needing it for business doesn't concern them.I own two HP desktop machines, each one costing over $2,000... an absurd amount for Windows PCs, but I really do need this stuff for business.  I am a designer, photographer, writer, and filmmaker.  Search my name on Amazon and you will find some of my cookbooks.  I have done the design and food photography for cookbooks with over 1 million copies in print.  Last year, I co-authored, designed, and photographed Great Food Fast, the 5th bestselling cookbook of the year.  I am also a filmmaker.  On June 4th, an award-winning movie I shot called "The Battery" will be released nationally by the same distributor as Super Size Me and Exit Through the Gift Shop.  The movie was entirely edited, sound mixed, and color corrected on HP computers.  My HP computers did the work of an entire post-production studio.  When it comes to design, photography, and filmmaking, I have to constantly defend my use of Windows PCs instead of the more industry accepted Macs, so I guess this is my lesson learned.Now, here I am, flying up to NY next week to promote the national release of my movie, and even after 19 days dealing with HP, I won't have a laptop to bring with me.  I need to go up there to film and then edit commercials and promotional material requested by the press and my only option is to buy an entirely new laptop to do this... leaving myself with a $1300 paperweight that I'd be lucky to sell used for $800 if an when it ever got fixed.  Quite honestly, I'd be afraid to sell it used, as I don't want to be responsible if and when it simply broke again for the next sad sack who purchases it from me.Stay far, far away from this model... and I'd say to stay far away from HP if you expect a working device, or at least a warranty repair to take any less than a month.  I'm still holding out hope that HP will read this and look up my case, under the name Christian Stella.  But, seeing as I already have a caseworker (Diana) at the highest level of customer service, and she can't do anything to help me, I'm sure I'm simply screwed.Quite honestly, I feel like filming myself taking a hammer to this piece of crap, since I won't even be able to use it for the first thing I actually need to use it for.  I have no confidence in their repair technicians after the last repair resulted in them simply reinstalling Windows, something I could have done myself.You can search YouTube for "Christian Stella Spectre Touchsmart" if you want to see how bad my issues with this laptop are.

I purchased this laptop because of it's sleek design and touch screen. Everything was great the first couple of hours. Then I powered it down and left it to charge over night. When I came back to it, I noticed that the power adapter light was still orange. I powered on the laptop, and the battery charge was stuck at 11%. I unplugged it, plugged it back in, even changed power outlets, nothing worked.I checked the reviews to see if anyone else had this problem, and read a few complaints about the screen coming off of the bezel. When I checked mine, sure enough, same issue on the bottom left of the screen. I sent it back to Amazon and decided to try my luck on a second one.When I powered on the second laptop, the first thing I noticed was a dead pixel. My first thought was "You've got to be kidding me!" Then I checked the screen, and it was coming out of the bezel on the bottom right.Doesn't HP check these things before they ship out? I'm shocked that a laptop this expensive has these types of manufacturing defects. I sent the second one back and will wait until later this year when the Intel Haswell Ultrabooks come out. Hopefully there will be a nice ASUS Ultrabook since I doubt I will be buying another HP product any time soon.

Update:  It just keeps getting worse.  After getting the repaired computer back and beginning to reload software, the USB ports stopped working.  HP was unable to troubleshoot remotely, so I once again packed up my new computer (which is not even two months old) and sent it back again.  It has now been 11 days since HP has had my computer.  I am told it was repaired, but then failed again in their testing.  They refuse to send me a new computer and will not tell me when they will be able to fix my defective computer. I spent over $1,200 for this computer and have gotten no productive use from it.I have had my computer for about 1 month, and am extremely disappointed in both the overall quality and in HP's horrible service and support.  I was initially pleased with the Touchsmart's high quality screen and relatively light weight.  However, in the first week of use I noticed intermittent distortion in the sound quality.  After verifying the problem occurred regardless of the audio source, I called HP technical support and was told that I needed to download updated drivers, which I had already done, but none the less followed the instructions of the HP rep.  This did not solve the problem, so I called HP tech support several more times and went through several more rounds of trouble shooting.  Finally , I reached a more knowledgeable rep who informed me that the distorted sound was a known issue with the Spectre Touchsmart sound card, and the only solution was to ship my notebook back to HP to have the sound card replaced.  I specifically informed them to not re-image or remove any of the software that I had installed on this notebook, but they disregarded my instructions and re-imaged the hard drive wiping out my Windows Pro upgrade, Microsoft Office and several other software packages that I have not been able to reinstall.  This was completely unnecessary to replace a sound card.The negatives of this notebook (defective sound card, horrible customer service, poor batter life) far outweigh the positives (good screen size and resolution relative to weight).  Bottom line, I strongly recommend you consider better options that the HP Spectre Touchsmart.  Why would you want to buy a product with a known issue with the sound card and poor customer support to back it up.

Love the Laptop but I bought for my wife and need W8.1 as it has a start button and looks more Windows 7 like.  HP is telling me W8.1 is garbage and do not update and just stay with Windows 8.  This is not an acceptable answer and I am working with a HP case manager to resolve matter.

Absolutely unsolvable DPC/latency spikes with this machine. When I say that I spent well over a month troubleshooting and tweaking the OS to resolve the problem, I mean it. Nothing worked. I even installed Windows 7 on there, so the same deplorable results. DO NOT BUY for DJ use. I bought a MacBook Pro and am happily running Windows 7 on it.For details, see my post at the Native Instruments Traktor forum:[...]

This is laptop look amazing and that about it. For $1200 it has so many negative things that i would be disappointed even if it was $600.First the fan noise! It is absolutely ridiculous how fast fan starts working and how nosiy it is. Even after regural internet surfing more than 5 minutes it starts "working" and the noise is like an old refrigerator. I can't imagine what would be if you want to play some game. It does cools down at some point but after 4 minute of normal word processing it starts again like you are playing some demanded game. Unacceptable!!Although the touchscreen is nice the screen actually sticks out of the frame?? One part of bottom screen is not insert into plastic! Like it is some copycat brand device or something.Even though i am not an Apple fan, touch pad is sooo far from any apple device.Otherwise if you disregard those major faults, laptop is good for what is worth. Nothing special, just good, and good looking.

tl;dr this laptop is terrible, don't buy it.This laptop was terrible. I purchased it at a retail Microsoft Store because I do UI art/production art work for a Microsoft Vendor and I wanted a laptop with an IPS display. To it's credit, the display did look really good (albeit glossy, but pretty much all IPS displays are). From day one, I was having some weird performance issues that are hard to describe and difficult to recreate. I'll explain:When playing a song or watching a video, the song or video will periodically stutter. Say if a singer is singing, for example, they'll artificially "hold" the note just a wee bit longer. It happens really fast--like less than a second--but it's obviously long enough and frequent enough to notice. The frequency of the stutter varied. Sometimes the computer cooperated and it wouldn't occur at all in a single sitting. Other times it was unbearable, stuttering several times in the span of a few seconds. These performance stutters would even effect video games or production applications, like Google SketchUp or Adobe Premiere. Not even audio-recording was safe; after playing back a voiceover sample I would come across portions of the audio track where syllables in dialog were missing--they would just skip about randomly.At first I tried to shrug the performance issues off. I had figured maybe Windows 8 was journaling the hard drive for a while or something, and that eventually performance would level-off. I was wrong. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I casually restarted the computer simply as a routine restart. I got up to get a glass of water and when I came back it hadn't rebooted. Just a black screen. I waited a while and eventually hard-booted it, which then returned the computer to a System Restore bootup process. What?! I chose a System Restore point that was only a few days old, and while it seemed to work I got an error message. Once back in Windows, my Microsoft Office stopped working. It told me that I didn't have a licensed version of the software, and that I would have to log back into my Office365 account. Even after successfully logging in and verifying, closing-and-relaunching the Office app as instructed incurred the same error/unlicensed responses. So it remembered nothing.I returned this POS laptop to Microsoft and had them do an extensive hardware diagnostic, and to my shock they reported that they found nothing physically wrong/defective with the laptop. They graciously offered me an exchange, so I am returning this thing and going with a different brand.

Very bad hp touch smart. Do not believe hp, it's very very bad quality and design. Overheating and damn performance.

My first major complaint with the laptop is Windows 8.  After giving it a while, I've decided that it isn't just a learning curve - I hate it.  Unfortunately HP does not support downgrading to 7, and attempting to do it myself seems to have completely bricked the machine (the restore process hung and now the "startup" screen won't even come up.)  I'll waste a bunch of time with HP tech support, but I just wish I had not foolishly tried another HP laptop.

I am a power windows user and have been looking for a light weight Ultrabook comparable to the MacBook Pro that I could use as a near desktop replacement.  Given how rave the reviews are for the MacBook Pro, it has been harder and harder to justify not switching to the MBP, but who has time to learn all the nuances of the Mac and I use a lot of Excel and QuickBooks, which don't play nice with Mac.  Thus, I was very excited to learn about this computer.  Its actually lighter than the MacBook Pro and comparable in most respects except the screen is a little lower Res.  I ordered one of the first Models with the 500 GB Solid State Drive in late Feb.  I got it March 14th and it completely died on May 8th - 55 days start to finish for a $2,400 computer (with all the bells and whistles).  Sorry Lenovo, but I expect better than this.Apparently, it failed to turn itself off after I turned it off and left my office one night and it got too hot.  This is interesting, because I have left it on all night before with no problems.  In fact, I have been impressed at how little heat it generates while operating.  When I got there in the morning, it was non-responsive .  I was able to finally turn it off by unplugging it and holding the off button for a long time.  After letting it cool down, I turned it on again, but the whole thing shorted out and it is now completely dead - totally non-responsive, except the keyboard backlights are flashing at me every 3 seconds.  Definitely a short of some kind.I always buy Lenovo's premium on-site warranty that guarantees on site service within 24 hours,  However, much to my Chagrin, Lenovo was unable to get someone here.  Thus, I would give this Computer and Lenovo's Warranty Service Negative five stars if I could.  I have been a dedicated Think Pad user for 20 years and the quality has definitely gone down since Lenovo bought the business.  This is the straw that broke the Camel's back for me.  I am heading over to the Apple Store to do what I should have done originally.  I have friends with Mac Books that are seven years old and they have never had problems.  I haven't gotten more than three years from a ThinkPad in a long time.Incidentally, I was talking to the Lenovo Warranty Dept today and they said they are starting to get a lot of calls on these.  I would stay away.  Its not worth the frustration.By the way, I also completely agree with the other reviewers.  The Keyboard is huge giant step backwards.  If you still buy this computer after reading this review, be advised that you will be really frustrated unless you have an external keyboard.  The slightest touch on the adaptive keyboard sends you into Adaptive Keyboard hell and destroys your productivity. and putting the end and back keys where the cap locks key used to be is just stupid.

I bought an inspiron 1764 from dell.  When the microwave gets turned on my internet is lost.  Never happened with my Toshiba!!  First off, I will say that Dell customer service is the worst!!!  Never have I seen such bad service.  I complained to the BBB and they sent out a technician with a new wireless card but we spent 2 hours trying to download the driver.  Then the technician came out again and they sent the same damn wireless card and we had the same damn problem!!!  They wanted to leave that card in my laptop and then have me call their software division to get it working...Since I knew how incompetent dell was I said no!!  When I tried to call them back they said the person I was speaking to would call them back and I never heard from him!!!  If you want to risk buying a laptop from dell with very bad customer service, then I wish you the best.  My Toshiba was a great laptop and have heard people praise Toshiba and people say the same about dell as I have!!!

Don't buy this machine. With some research you will see it has a chronic problem with screen failures. Mine failed after 2 year and wasn't worth fixing even though I had invested $600 originally in it (new machines are faster and have warranty and repair for this would be $175-$300 depending upon whether it was the motherboard or the LCD. STAY AWAY FROM DELL JUNK!

First off this computer was a gift after mine broke mine was a hp that was only 300 dollars new and it could run any game or app on low but this dell is about 800 dollars and cant run any game i have at lowest settings even minecraft AT ITS LOWEST settings cant get more than 20fps and for all who dont know thats really bad so if you want a computer for office use dont spend 800 dollars on this over priced piece of crap.

First, like macbook, I got the flickering effect from the first day when I disconnected it from the charging cable. This is understandable because the battery is not powerful enough.Second, GTX 860m in this labtop is suppose to have better performance than GTX675m in my Samsung Gamer 7, however, this laptop lags A LOT when I tried to play medal of honor warfighter in low settings.It even lagged when I tried to play SWAT 4, which is not even a high end game! The system message said that I don't have enough graphic memory space.My direct X is the most recent one. And it says that It is using GTX860m graphics not onboard intel graphics. I don't know what the problem is.In brief summary, DON'T buy this. Especially if you expect high performance gamer.

I had this laptop for about 6 months then the HDD failed, no big deal, but do to lack of driver support from sony's website i never got the laptop to run like it did when i first got it. HUGE WAS OF MONEY. The wanted me to pay something like $300 to send me a recovery cd!!!!!  The charging port also works intermittently. I ended up buying a 13inch Macbook Pro and I've never looked back.

I bought my Sony Vaio 9 months ago with an extended warranty. It worked well for 6 months until one day the speakers completely died on me.I have spent the next 3 months trying to get Sony to repair the laptop for me. I spent the first month just on the phone, trying to convince tech support that my computer had had a hard drive failure. Over the next month-and-a-half they had three appointments where they sent people over to repair my computer. The first time they replaced the speakers, the second time they replaced the motherboard and the third time they replaced the sound card. All three attempts were unsuccessful; the sound still did not work.My computer is now at a repair center. I have no computer (I had to borrow someone else's computer to write this review).This is my experience with Sony Vaio. Maybe you'll have a better one. Who knows?

I purchased a Toshiba Satellite S55t Laptop Computer recently.  The computer is mostly fine.  The one weakness I noticed that the battery was only holding charge for an hour or so.  I called Toshiba tech support to get a new part, since my computer is still under warranty.  Everything went wrong with this call.  I had to speak with two people, giving them the same verification info before I got a rep to talk to me.  Then did he ever talk.  Wow.  His first language wasn't English, so he didn't know how to spell the word "request," which is part of my email.  I had to repeat it several times.  Then he put me on hold three separate times to ask someone else the answer to my question.  He wanted to continue with troubleshooting that included turning my computer off and on, with the same hesitancy and time-consuming nonsense.  I finally said "Just send me the part.  I have stuff to do and can't waste any more on this."  He then told me he'd be sending me a link that I could use to order the part myself.  Couldn't he have offered this as an option up front? The call in total took 28 minutes.  So I went to the link and ordered the part.  Guess what?  Even though my computer is still under warranty, I have to pay $144 up front to assure return of my old battery, refundable upon return.  We all know that I'm bound for another hassle if the return doesn't get recorded.  Most people will return them even if there's no charge.  And what do these things costs to manufacture?  A buck tops?  So guess what?  They've just insured they get back a part worth a buck, and in the process created ill will toward their products because their customer service is so terrible.  On every level they created ill will.  I like this laptop but support is such a pain that I probably won't buy a Toshiba product again.Customer service is a pain the butt that stops your workflow in the best of situations.  Customer service is something that should be almost invisible to the user.  Users want contact with a human being.  They want this person to be able to use English fluently (or Spanish, or whatever language the support is in).  They want this person to be trained to independently solve all common problems.  I would think that getting replacement parts would be a very common problem.  And they want it to be fast, because the failure of a purchase to perform is something you don't (and shouldn't have to) anticipate.  So any time spent resolving this is a hassle.  Then it would be nice if they value their customers enough to send out a replacement part without saying "I don't trust you."  Just my opinion.

This product is a total waste of money. It's unable to complete windows upgrades (which it will try to do more or less very time you turn it on). The audio is crap. It's just a poorly designed laptop.

I purchased this laptop towards the end of 2010. At that time, Lenovo was bundling the laptop with Windows 7 OS. When I upgraded with the Windows 7 OS copy that Lenovo sent to me, my battery stopped working.I contacted Lenovo several times to resolve the issue. Their technicians at first denied the existence of the problem (even though many people have encountered this issue), then later upon subsequent calls stated they did not know what the problem is. They ran me through circles of updating firmware, power drivers, etc. but nothing worked. All this time I could only use my laptop while it was plugged into an outlet, no real mobility could be achieved with it. Whats the point of a laptop then?Luckily for the miserly geniuses that work at [communist] Chinese owned and operated Lenovo,  my warranty expired shortly thereafter. I call again later hoping the evil geniuses have 'figured out' the problem and they now want to charge me approximately $60 to diagnose as I am out of warranty.Please take a moment to read their forums before you purchase.My laptop has buttons that have popped off, a hinge that is broken, and trim work that is broken. Its truly a piece of crap laptop and I'm an IT expert that has used: Toshibas, Dells, HPs, Macs, etc. and have NEVER, EVER seen such a poorly built laptop. Even the keys feel cheap. I should have not purchased this without testing it out at the store first, I got performance/price greedy and liked the hardware specs.NOT WORTH IT. NEVER BUY A LENOVO.

This is one of the most horrible laptops I have ever used/seen. I still prefer to use my 5 year old HP Laptop over this one.- The touchpad is sooooo frustrating. It sometimes gets too sensitive and sometime would not respond. I have tried different settings but to no avail.- What can I say about the boot time. I power it up and can go around for few minutes and it wouldn't boot up completely when I return.- The keyboard layout is weird. You would find keys that you would hardly use easier to reach. But the ones you need always, are hard to find.- The keys are very flimsy.I wish could return this. Never buy it, it's a BIG WASTE OF MONEY.

Before I launch into my vindictive diatribe, I would like to say that perhaps I am in error. Perhaps I did not take better care of my computer (although I doubt it, since my previous laptop from Acer lasted me a good 4.5 years, all through my undergraduate career, and had been subject to much more battering than this laptop), or that I should have been more sensitive to this computer's needs, but at this point, I am very convinced that I will never buy a laptop from Lenovo again. This is my first review, possibly my only review ever, but my experience with Lenovo has been so bad that I think you deserve a warning.Service Issues:1) Lenovo messed up my online order. I'm not even sure how this is possible. First, they said my CC did not get authorized. I called my bank. They said they authorized it. Lenovo denied it again. Lenovo told my bank to call them so they can work things out. Convoluted things happen. They do so, and I receive my laptop. Unfortunately, I'm charged twice for the same laptop, and Lenovo sends me a two copies of the same laptop. I try sending the first one back, but they do not give me a warning when the person will come to pick it up. Because of the nature of my job, I cannot simply just wait around all day waiting for the mailman. I hold unto the laptop. (my mistake)2) I finally call Lenovo again to send in the extra laptop. They give me a code. I put it on the box, go to the UPS store and ship it in. A few weeks later, I get a notice saying that the shipment never arrived. I call, they look into it; apparently, they received a box without anything in it. At this point, exasperation ensues. How is that even possible? They file a missing box/shipment. The issue is, to my knowledge, still unresolved.Now, onto the laptop itself.1) Webcam breaks within 3 weeks. It picks up light, but monochromatically. Not worth using. (It was good when it worked though)2) Battery breaks down within 5 months. Laptop recognizes that battery is plugged in, but does not use it. I've been told that because the battery isn't part of the warranty, I have to pay for it myself. Fine. I'll do it once I finish my project and don't need a laptop. (FYI, you need to send in this computer back to Lenovo so they can fix it. You will be laptopless for a while, not sure how long since I cannot send it in until after one of my projects is completed. But, still a major major inconvenience.)3) Sound quality is terrible. The laptop sound system crackles often, and although it is loud, the incessant sound fuzz is just enough to just have me plug in my iPod instead directly into the laptop itself. I am not an audiophile, so people with more refined auditory systems might be really repulsed by the sound.3) As a minor pro, in contrast to the major cons, it IS a fairly light laptop. However, there is a great sense of fragility to this laptop, and does not feel at all sturdy. After my webcam and battery breaking, I'm just afraid that this machine is going to break down completely. I've stopped carrying it around as much, and have relegated it as a desktop-laptop, which of course, completely gets rid of the very idea of having a portable laptop in the first place.Conclusion:I wish my experience with Lenovo had been more positive, that they could get the order right in the first place, and that this laptop was not so fragile. Overall, there seems to be better options available, so I recommend you look elsewhere first. I wasn't suckered into buying this laptop; I thought it would be genuinely good. I do like that they put in Windows 7, that the processor is fast, the RAM quick, the keyboard "clicky". But, my personal experience with Lenovo has been so bad that I just cannot in good conscience recommend this laptop.

Research the documented motherboard issue on the HP Pavilions before you buy!!!!  I thought for many years that HP was a trusted reliable brand.  I spent $1200 on this HP just to find out 13 months in that there is a motherboard issue.  This unit overheats easily (often without you being aware) and you will lose your motherboard (and your investment will be lost). The dv7 has the same overheating/motherboard problem that the other pavilion dv series exhibits.  If you buy the unit anyway (or have already purchased) watch carefully for signs of problems BEFORE the 1 year warranty expires.  Motherboard problems can present initially as odd issues such as power problem (powering off, turning off while booting up, etc).  ALWAYS use laptops on a hard surface.  In this case using a cooling surface didn't prevent the problem but often this can help you avoid issues.  Good luck!

Basically what happens is this laptop works amazingly for about a year, then all sorts of problems start showing up right after the warranty expires, and HP then charges you out the ass to fix. Major problem I ran into was the overheating: the vents aren't directly over the GPU or CPU, and so if there's any sort of dust build up AT ALL, or lack of a cooling pad for too long, the whole thing overheats and basically just melts itself. This obviously requires you to replace the motherboard, which HP will do for you for about $400. Second issue, which I just recently ran into EVEN AFTER GETTING THE MOBO REPLACED, is that the power connector on the motherboard is awful. If you torque the power cord while it's plugged in, it'll pop loose on the inside, and your laptop will no longer be able to receive power from an external source: meaning you have until your battery is dead to backup and save everything on your laptop. Still trying to sort out this most recent issue, but I would have to recommend people who expect a laptop to last more than a year (as I hope most people would), steer clear of this model.

My DV7 lasted 15 months before it started failing to recognize the power adapter.  This is a chronic problem with the HP DV series.  HP offered me the opportunity to spend $400 to replace the motherboard.Google this laptop before buying, and be aware of the problems others have experienced.

Much to late probably to help anyone,,except that to add to what all the one star raters are saying.  It is true,,the dv7's are overheating and having battery issues.  I replaced the hard drive on mine after only 8 months.  The reason people are seeing 4 stars on  reviews is that these computers work well when they are working and most are first time reactions or new purchase reviews.  I was very pleased with the performance of mine,,which I payed 800 for at military store.  My graphics card was only 500mb on my model but the chassis and designs must be very similar with the dv7's across the board because right now mine is sitting on my living room floor fried after loud fan noises and shutting down from overheating.  At one time I was able to keep the laptop on by placing it over a pan of ice,,,eventually this did not work either.  Not going to purchase HP again.  Bought My daughter a Samsung laptop 3 months after mine in 2011 and it is still going strong,,

The computer functioned great at first but after a year or so the computer developed multiple problems.-loud fan issues-constant errors-overheating-battery life was near non existentOverall I wouldn't recommend this computer. It is fast and functions at first but will crap out on you.

Why I wouldn't buy this PC again.Like all electronics, just because it happens to one, does not mean it will happen to everyone. I know that I'm not stupid, but a fair amount of things have happened to this PC that make me raise an eyebrow at it's hardware.Issues (in order-)1. The ac adapter died.After 11 months of good computer service, my adapter died. The replacement was roughly $95.002. The fan broke.After a year and a half (from the time I bought it) the fan broke and was hitting the side. Since I was still under warranty, HP covered it.3. The battery went badOver a year and a half the battery didn't hold a charge for more then 30 minutes. OH! And I had to talk to about twelve people from HP, and seven told me warranty covered it, the rest said it wasn't the battery was about $80 I believe.4. My computer had an error and would not respond.Exactly a week after my two year mark (warranty expired at that time) My computer had an error that made it not respond. When I called HP it would cost $300.00 to repair it. After slewing through countless internet help sites I found something that fixed it...in two minutes.5. My computer had a different error that told me my windows was counterfeit. HP put me on hold for an hour, but as soon as they had my information (telling them I was out of warranty) they all but hung up on me. I called Microsoft and I had to hold a little longer but my computer was fixed...FOR FREE.Honestly this computer has had far more problems in two years then computers I've had to five. I have a computer from 2003 that is a tank, but this computer is a cheap plastic imitation of what a "entertainment pc" should be. I don't know if I'd ever buy a HP again, but I know it would not be this one.

I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this laptop. After exhaustive research I chose this laptop as a gift for my wife. After reading favorable reviews and believing that HP produced a quality product I thought this laptop was a good buy given its pricepoint and features. BOY was I wrong!!!First off, despite this machines apparent hardware prowess it is SLOW AS DIRT!!! I have tried to investigate why the cpu always seems to be bogged down, but after turning off several services related to Windows Media Player, changing the power profile, and reducing instances of constant 50-100% cpu usage it still runs slow. Right out of the box, without any software tweeking it was a dog!Speaking of Windows media, although this is billed as an "entertainment" PC do not try and ask it to perform any media functions. I tried to stream music from this machine to a PS3 for playback and the associated services you must turn on caused the cpu to be pegged at 100%.....even when there was no music steaming, thus rendering it useless for any other function!!I work in IT and I know that computers are not supposed to perform like this if they are engineered correctly. It may just be that Windows 7 is total crap or that this machine is under-engineered to be able to run it. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk unless you fancy watching the spinning circle everytime you want to open a webpage, program or document. This computer is now a barely useable PC that my wife tries to work from home on. I never even got into in this review the cheap build quality.....Thin plastic...feels like you could break it just picking it up. I could tolerate this if not for all the other glaring flaws. HP should be ashamed to have there name associated with this product. Next time I buy a laptop I will be looking to a different manufacturer.

I bot Windows 7 pro got xp mode going , ran into some problems syncing my Ipod 7 & xp mode.Hp did not have very many drive thats where compatible with xp.there was no dvd player in Xp mode. its been nuts. what am I going to do.start all over again with all new software. some of my favorite xp software was not compatible with xp mode

I bought this computer for my fiance for school and it has been a complete NIGHTMARE. Google Dell laptop cursor problems or mouse problems. The computer randomly will select things when you dont even touch it! She cannot even use the computer because while using it the computer will select a different window, or tab, or paragraph etc etc. We have told dell of the problem and been through hours and hours of customer service bull crap. Every time its someone who barely speaks english and they have us do that same perfunctory steps that we have already done. Finally they replaced the mousepad and mother board. Guess what?? IT STILL HAS THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM. I then spent 3 hours on the phone trying to get them to replace the laptop.....they wouldnt do it!! I called multiple times to talk to a manage and each time the manager was "IN A MEETING" which means they either were lying or do not have managers. Lastly we sent it in to get repaired through dells 3rd party company. They replaced the hard drive and the operating system. YET AGAIN THE SAME PROBLEM PERSISTS!! DELL SELLS CRAP COMPUTERS AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE CRAP!!! HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM, LOOK ONLINE AT FORUMS!! I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DELL AGAIN, TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER IF YOU WANT IT TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN A PAPER WEIGHT!!EDIT: DELL HAS DISABLED REVIEWS ON THE DELL WEBSITE...AFTER LOG IN AND CLICKING ON THE "WRITE REVIEW" BUTTON YOU GET REDIRECTED TO THE COMPUTER SALE PAGE!! IT IT LIKE THIS FOR EVERY LAPTOP!! WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT DELL PRODUCTS??

No customer should buy this product once again I have invested 1643$ on this but I missed that item when is was requested for the refund they even not responded for this request waste customer service from amazon

I bought this from micro center because I had purchased another computer from amazon and had to send it back because of a personal preference issue and I did not want to be stuck with a postage charge again.I have the same issue of the computer not shutting down and having to hold the power button for an extended time to shut the machine down. I was instructed by hp to do this.Finally, after four calls to support and their trying to fix the issue, they want to have the computer back so they can repair it.It will take THREE weeks! I have barely owned the computer for that long! And I will have to reinstall software for the Wacom tablet and photoshop elements 11!I am taking pictures of the computer before I send it back because they said if there are any damage issues, these are not covered under warranty.I have read other reviews that have had a difference of opinion between owner and repair as to damage.I intend to protect myself from charges.By the way, possible future owners of this machine, hp support says that this shut down issue is a known issue with this machine. BEWARE!

It has some sort of bios issue that caused it to need rebooting (via battery removal)  each and every time it was shut down or even just went into sleep mode due to inactivity.  Learned this only after 2 days of installing and updating.  Very frustrating and a huge waste of precious time.  Amazon took it back, absolutely no hassle!!!  And then when UPS lost my return package (I waited 10 days) they issued me a credit anyway.  The return package did eventually get found and returned to Amazon.  For me, the HP Pavillion was a dud but it was almost worth it to be treated so well by Amazon.  The computer gets one star, Amazon gets 5 stars!

I used the computer for about a week and started having problems with the computer not waking up from Sleep mode.  I had to restart the computer completely every time it went into Sleep mode.The problem got worse once I contacted HP Support.  The first person I spoke with asked me to reset the computer to its factory settings.  I was new to Windows 8 and asked for instructions in resetting the computer.  I tried to follow them but I was kept getting an error message stating something was missing from a drive and it could not restart.  I contacted HP again and they said they would send a box for me to send the computer to them and they would repair the problem, I was informed this would take about nine days.  After only having the computer for 7 days I told them this was unacceptable and they could sending a new computer would be the only resolution to this problem that I would be satisfied with.  I was informed a Case Manager would contact me shortly.  I started playing around in the settings and got the computer to reset itself to factory settings.  This was really aggravating, your Support Tech could not give proper instructions and with Google and 10 minutes I was able to get the reset started.  A couple hours after the reset was done the problem was still not fixed.  I contacted Amazon, returned the product and went back to Toshiba.  I was tried HP because of a suggestion from a friend and the price of the product.  Never again will I return, mostly because of their poor service.Two days after I sent the HP back for a refund I got a call for the Case Manager apologizing about the problem and asked if I could send the computer in so they could fix it.  After explaining how disappointed I was in their product and poor Tech Support I told her I returned the product and was going back to Toshiba which I have used for years.  She apologized again then offered an extended warranty on any HP computer.Thanks for nothing HP!

Week one.  Had issues with BIOS.  When  I called tech support it was the worst experience I have EVER encountered.  I will not recommend anyone to use HP support.  My issue was resolved with a Microsoft support tech that knew exactly what my issue was and informed me what I had to do to resolve it.  I believe having support is NOT hiring idiots from another country to try to resolve issues they have NO knowledge of.  Bad move on HP part.  I am very disappointed in the service I received and will NOT purchase another HP product.

laptop had great features & looked great for a good price, ***HOWEVER*** the touch-pad was completely defective, the wireless had connectivity problems AND the screen dimming-brightening feature was also faulty, it would dim & even go completely black when I tried to brighten it and then bright when I would try to darken (or vice-versa).  The cherry on top of all this trouble was Lenovo's JOKE of a "repair" depot, after spending 1.5hrs with tech support, including them remotely connecting to my machine and adjusting all the settings of the touch-pad and downloading different drivers AND waiting 10 days to get my laptop back, the laptop did the EXACT SAME THING right out of the box when I got it back.  The repair depot "tech" noted on the paper that he fixed the problem by "resetting touch-pad to factory settings"??????!!!!!  I called LENONO's repair depot and within 2 minutes the tech was asking me to return the laptop so they could replace the touch-pad...i said WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS DO THAT WHEN I SENT IT BACK THE FIRSTTIME??" he replied "I'm not sure".I have since returned the laptop back to Amazon for a full refund and purchased a new HP ENVY DV6 that is beyond meeting my expectations.Do your homework before buying, read these reviews and learn from the rest of us.Happy Hunting

this laptop was my first and last lenovoif all you want to do is park it on a desk -  you'll probably be fine - but if you want all the portability features of a laptop - skip this one!After just 6 weeks - here's what I've encountered1.  When the battery gets low - the wifi shuts off and does not turn back on once plugged in/charged. The trouble-shooters tell you to "turn the wifi switch on" ... there IS NO wifi switch!!2.  After a couple of weeks - the battery stopped charging up all the way - it would charge up to 50% - and display "plugged in, not charging" - none of the power-management options included a means of shutting this off. I had to call Lenovo support - they blamed it on my installing software (of course) and walked me through uninstalling the old Win 7 power management utility and downloading a Win 8 one. My u510 shipped with Win 8 ... so ... ??3.  Now that I have the new "win 8" power management utility - the settings seem stuck on "max performance" no matter what I do - so I fly through my "5 hour" battery in under 2.75 hours. Lenovo tech support has no solution for this4.  It took 3 phone-calls and a slew of e-mails to the Lenovo extended warranty department to get them to give me my full 2 year extended warranty ... they kept setting the expiration date of my warranty to nearly 3 months BEFORE I even purchased the laptop!! I eventually got this fixed - but why was this even ever an issue??5.  There is an extremely LOUD low battery beep that starts beeping ever 3 or so seconds once the battery is down to 10%. THERE IS NO WAY TO SHUT THIS OFF!!! Not in windows, not in BIOS ... you're stuck with this laptop making this obnoxious racket. And - so helpful - even if you close the lid - it keeps beeping. You have to actually shut it down to make the beeping stop. Lenovo tech support just says "we can't do anything about that".So - to sum up This laptop is ...not particularly fastnot particularly well pricednot particularly well madenot at all a good laptop for mobile tech workers using public spaces (coffee shops, libraries) - or possibly going to drain the battery in front of clientsI've been using laptops since 94 and have used Toshibas, HP's, Dells and have never had any of these issues on any of those brands.bottom line: the Lenovo u510 is the MOST INCONVENIENT laptop I have ever owned! I would return it in a heart beat ... pity I didn't know lenovo only gives you 3 weeks to evaluate their laptops

I tried two models of this laptop - one with ELAN touchpad and one with Synaptic. Synaptic one was kind of OK, but the ELAN one was horrible. I don't know why Lenovo won't recall this product instead of letting customers buy, return and give a very bad review. This laptop is is useless with this touchpad (otherwise a nice pick). Hope they do something seriously about the touch pad.

Bought it for my daughter because of the price and Lenovo/IBM reputation. I was an IBM employee and own IBM stock as such I get discounts on products including Lenovo. When IBM sold Lenovo their PC business the products were being built to IBM standards. Today the chinese who own Lenovo are making chinese fishing boats, sometimes known as Junks. The touch pad is twitchy, the wifi drops out on a regular basis, the only fix is to turn airplane mode on and off run the troublshooter, restart the Laptop and then rerun the troubleshooter. Twice a week. The laptop turned off a month after buying it and would not come back on. I bought an in home repair warranty at that point which is retroactive to purchase date from lenovo. Guy came out replaced the motherboard, seemed to work fine until he put the last screw in and the issue came back. He took the laptop back apart and found that the screw presses on a cable. He made sure the cable was properly in the channel designed for it. The problem has not come back yet. All of these issues point to sorry Quality control (my wife is a quality engineer)and design. Having a screw press on a power cable is a poor design. When I called about the power issue with the warranty information the "technician" on the phone told me it would not go into effect for 30 days. It clearly states on the Lenovo site that it is retro to the purchase date. I had to make several more calls,get tranferred several times until that was handled. Wish I had bought an Apple instead. My son has an Apple and it works great. The Lenovo came with windows 8, worst operating system ever. Would change to 7 if I could.

Poor performance. That is why there are so many "refurbished" ones for sale. Trick is it will work fairly well until return policy is over and you are stuck with "warrenty" repairs which means you will not have your computer for months. Stay away.

I tried two of these computers from Amazon.  Both had the same problem.  The trackpad works fine for the first day or so and then the mouse starts jumping all over the screen.  I contacted Lenovo Customer Support.  They tried reinstalling the driver and adjusting the sensitivity, but neither worked.  I had the same thing happen on the second U510 I ordered as well.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this laptop to anyone.  The Lenovo customer support rep said that he is dealing with this issue constantly and that they haven't found a cure for the problem.

I purchased this computer in Jan of 2013.  Originally I was quite happy with it, it worked perfectly and I even liked Windows 8.  Then, a few weeks ago it started to get a little sluggish, and taking longer and longer to boot up.  Next, it suddenly began freezing during the startup process.  I've reformatted the hard drive to no avail (so it's a hardware problem), but it broke 2 months past their 1 year warranty, so tech support is no help to me.  It *will* turn on.. after 2 tries and about 30 min.  Unacceptable.I am extremely disappointed - I expected this laptop to last more than a year.  Don't buy it!!!

I bought this Lenovo because my professional laptop was a Lenovo T-series. But it was a big mistake as this product line doesn't have the same quality and some basic issues in the design. When I bought, there was no negative review but reading them right now, all of them are true. Just to highlight some of them that most concerns me: (i)Win8 factory installed in the HD disk instead in the SSD disk; (ii) when the battery goes away, the system shut down the wifi and there is no way to turn it on again except rebooting; (iii) trackpad doesn't work, I decided to buy a cheap Logitec mouse instead to get nuts.Lenovo lost a chance to do amazing. This laptop looks really good, thin, but they screwed up the product.Don't buy this product line until Lenovo fix all the issues.

It doesn't matter what troubleshooting I do, it doesn't matter if one of the options works for a short time, Lenovo has crappy batteries -- this whole "plugged in, not charging" issue is so ridiculous that I'll never buy a Lenovo again.

The HORRIBLE Lenovo U510 ideapad Ultrabook has been manufactured and sold with a completely defective track pad, which Lenovo has been unable and unwilling to repair for at least 2 years. The cursor skitters all over the page without even touching the track pad. It's even worse if you touch it. Can't left- or right click on anything because the cursor won't stay still long enough.There is no workaround; no drivers or settings will cure this problem. There are a host of other problems, but this one is untenable. I would never buy another product from this company.

Serious issues with the WiFi and touch-path... Check all the blog and comments about these two problems before buying this laptop

To quote another reviewer, this was my first and LAST Lenovo laptop.  I had high expectations based on it's specs.  However it would routinely lock up where nothing would work until a hard reboot.  Also another very common problem was the cursor would just freeze - nothing would move until I pressed and held the power key for another hard reboot.  I dealt with these issues, however 5 1/2 months after purchasing, the screen has gone black.  At start-up you see Lenovo and the spinning progress wheel...but after that it's just a pulsating black screen.  I now have to send it back to Lenovo for repairs and had to purchase another machine because I can't be without.It looks nice and promises good performance but it's a horrible waste of time and money.

A piece of crap.  Went bad within a year, and Dell had to buy it back from us.  Constant complaints yeilded many problems dealing with Dell.

I just bought this crap less than a year ago, just die from one to another day, first and last Dell I ever bought. They told me I am out of warrenty, have to throw it in the garbage . It's sad that bad quality overflows the world. It's a world where company's kill our planet with crap like this. Do not buy Dell.

it could have been because the seller sold a defective product though.  so i cannot recommend it.  also, dell customer service was hit and miss.  some techs great, others, well, not so much.

I got my new HP laptop for day one (it is not from Amazon) and HP tricked me to have a antivirus software installed during initial software installation.What really dirty here is they also ship a bunch of software fully of trojan horse and virus in the default software package. So when I try to use the internet browser for the first surf, the antivirus software jumps out like a gang and blocks me from doing anything, including uninstall itself!  Every time, I am forced to enter a page asking to pay $69.99 for their stupid and buggy software. Am I going to pay you the $69.99 stupid money that you are begging for?  NO!  I return this crap back to where it is from.It also reminds me another HP printer I had that it expires its ink box after a few months and I cannot print if I don't buy a new costy HP ink. The reason is to "Guarantee print quality". Come on, it's back ink!HP is running DIRTY business. It cheats, it begs. it sucks. It ties to dishonestly play dirty games with customers. Simply stay away from it!  It should go to the hell.

Right out of the box (November 8, 2012) the Wi-Fi speed of my Ideapad U410 was ridiculously low compared to my other laptop, which was sitting right next to it.I ran three speedtests:Ideapad U410 - Download Speed: 1.50Mbps, Upload Speed: 13.29MbpsAcer Aspire 5740 - Download Speed: 51.29Mbps, Upload Speed: 45.01MbpsI couldn't even watch a YouTube video without it stopping every 5 seconds for several minutes. Insane!Updating the Wi-Fi drivers did not solve the problem.FYI, the Lenovo support forum has a 57-page thread about this Wi-Fi issue, which Lenovo still does not acknowledge.[...]I would strongly recommend NOT purchasing this item because it comes with this serious flaw.

If you are doing your research before buying a new ultrabook, be advised that this particular model, as well as the U310 from Lenovo, both have MAJOR wifi issues. The problem is so bad that even Lenovo doesn't know what to do. Just read the forums and you will find people all over the globe sending their machines for over 3 different times with no successful fix!The internet at my place is a 10mb plan and works well on all others computers and smartphones I have, however, my U410 shows onl 0.3-0.4mb download speeds even if I'm right close to my router!! That is unacceptable! Lenovo says it's a hardware issuae, but how does that work if they can't fix the problems themself?? This company has scre*&^% over so many customers that I don't understand how they are still in business selling this notebook everywhere!Another big issue I have is with the battery. Do not fool yourself into thinking you've got an 8 hour battery that is supposed to last a full day at the office.... hahahaha it's more like 3.5-4 hours at the max on balanced mode! Plus, this unit does'nt have a backlit keyboard, the screen resolutions is a joke at 1366x768, it's thicker than the pictures illustrate and a little too heavy for a 14" ultrabook.The only pros I find is the processor and the HD4000 graphics which is just as good as the also installed Geforce 610m... yes, go read the reviews on this old video card and see it for yourself what kind of hardware they are pushing to us.This is the most valuable piece of info you may find online:[...]I wish I read that before buying this notebook.PS: No, all U410/U310 manufactured after 7/23/2012 STILL have the same wifi issue, do not trust the administrators from Lenovo! Would you buy a computer from a company which allegedly sells faulty items and just ignores customers when they ask for help in the forums??

The laptop which i bought worked fine for a month. After that a vertical green line came up on the screen and it was an LCD defect. I checked the warranty on lenovo site and found to my astonishment that the warranty had expired. The seller had sold me a laptop which was 1yr old.So please do not buy product from this seller. I was cheated by the seller as now I have to pay to get it repaired though my laptop is just 3 months old.

I had to send it in for repairs within a month of having it and it still didn't get fixed completely! Both Lenovo and this seller are giving the customers a defective product and you should not get this laptop!!! Save the extra cash and go for another PC or Mac. The company doesn't even want to own up to their product and give a refund for a defective product, I only dealt with it for the semester because I needed it for school.So avoid this ultrabook if possible otherwise good luck with what you get.

Between the aggressive pre-installed bloatware (power management, drive control, and other hidden programs) and the lack of option to upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 7, this laptop is unusable for much else other than checking email.  Windows 8 and 8.1 are nightmares in their own right, disallowing you to run many programs that would run fine on windows 7 (such as audio editing software and VSTi's), including many native 64 bit applications.  ASUS brings their own horrible bloatware to the table with hidden apps like Power4Gear which secretly overrides any power management options you set in Windows, ruining your work by putting your laptop to sleep or shutting it down without your permission when you least expect it and leaving you wondering what happened.I have been a big ASUS fan in the past, but this laptop has been a complete disaster for the last several weeks.  Even attempting to upgrade the special slim DVD drive to HDD storage requires special tools and professional level microsurgery involving over a dozen tiny T5 torx screws of varying lengths and complete removal of the entire back panel of the laptop (unlike most any other laptop).  If I wanted this much trouble upgrading a laptop, I would have bought an Apple.At this point, I may start over with something more friendly like an HP Elitebook.  Oh, and I'll be upgrading THAT one from Windows 8 to Windows 7!***Update***After considerable use, I must say this is hands down the worst computing experience I've had in 30 years.  When programs crash, they lock the entire system completely.  When the task manager is called via CTRL+ALT+DEL, it too crashes and freezes permanently (if it shows up at all, which is about a 60% chance).  Sadly, I've made a $1000 investment in this piece of garbage and am stuck unless I sell it to some poor unsuspecting person (which would be immoral).  Avoid this mistake and go with a company that offers support for Windows 7.***Another Update***This operating system is now preventing me from deleting files or folders I've created and placed in the My Documents folder or on the Desktop.  Restarting the computer has not solved the issue. Drive tests show the HDD to be fine, so it doesn't seem to be a hardware problem.  How bad does an OS have to be to have such a bug?  Because ASUS insists on supporting only WIN 8, the blame is theirs.  I used to be very supportive of ASUS.  All of my home-built and work-built towers sport ASUS motherboards.  They've completely lost my long term business by choosing to support Microsoft's wishes instead of their customers'.  If I had gone with anyone else, I might have had driver support for Win 7.  Avoid this laptop!!!***Final Update***Four different VSTi's (a few thousand dollar's worth) and a few other programs (some of which were 64 bit native) would not function properly in W8 or 8.1.  Amazon provided a refund.  Amazon is fantastic about that.  If all you are doing is browsing the internet or writing emails, this laptop will be fine for that.  Amazon is definitely the place to buy it for their return policy.  Power users or gamers, beware.

This is very worst laptop.Also, i heard that many dell laptops having the same issues. If you buy this one you will sure regret yourself. Waste of money.Please dont buy dell.

ordered as new, loads of confusion on amazon's part prior to christmas, received laptop on christmas eve, problems after 3rd day, when contacting dell, told that warranty was expired because  laptop was registered the year before to someone in California, I am in VA.  very disappointed.  Amazon refunded immmediately upon receipt of return but was lax in helping to find a suitable replacement.

I ordered this computer after looking at all the online reviews I could find. I've had good experiences with Gateway before, and I was drawn to everything this one came with (most notably, Windows 7; I have a deep loathing for 8).I received my laptop on Jan 8th, and everything was running smoothly. Unfortunately, starting the second day, my computer started freezing during Windows updates. By the fourth day, it was freezing when trying to wake from sleep mode. Today (day six), my trackpad quit responding; I had to use an external mouse. Rebooting didn't work, and everything was marked enabled.That was just one too many issues for me in less than a week of owning. I know not many others have complained of issues, so it might have just been this one unit, but I'm not taking that chance. I'm a college student who largely takes online classes, and I need a reliable computer. I'm returning this one, and getting a Toshiba instead.

So I posted this on Lenovo's page after my experience with their on-site tech today. I'm going to just keep posting this everywhere I can find.Lenovo; For Those Who Don't:January 23rd I received the IdeaPad Y510p from Lenovo, and it ran like a dream for 13 days, then I go to take my dog outside and put my laptop in sleep mode and come back in and it won't turn back on. I called in and had the option to return/refund it or repair it. I went with repair in hopes of being able to keep my data and awaited the box that tech support said I would be receiving in 3-5 days...It's the motherboard that needs replaced; power light turns on but the fans, hard drive, keyboard lights, screen, and even USB power are unresponsive. A $1,649 paperweight.20 days later I call back, having been busy with two jobs in Advertising, furious. I found out that it was never sent out and that it was just kind of forgot about. So you kindly "escalated" the repair to an on-site request after you said it would take almost twenty days for a repair and I would still have to wait, that you thought I was sending it in a second time for a second repair, and that you said I couldn't refund it until I told you I talked to a Sales Manager and they said I could and you looked into my history and found I actually did talk to someone and I could due to the situation.Well that on-site guy THAT YOU SENT OUT came today and broke the laptop even more. He lost one screw when taking it apart, forgot to put two screws back in, broke the bottom latch/lock for the laptop, part of the frame (a little plastic clip on the inside but it looks warped now) and was banging the laptop, jabbing it with his plastic tool, and kept saying "I sure hope I don't broke it, don't wanna do that!" I took pictures and cringed the whole time. I about had a stroke watching this guy "try and not break" my laptop. AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED. It's just been sitting on my desk since I got it.This is a work laptop.I not only make money on this laptop, I spend money on it monthly for my software.I make $18 an hour at the job I got this for, and it has cut back my time there drastically. I can't work there I can only work from home. I was averaging about 3-5 hours a day until the laptop broke. Now I get less because my home computer isn't meant for this work.The software is $20 a month that I can't use.My freelance pays $30-$60 an hour just for design fees.I've lost more money because of this laptop possibly than for what it's even worth.You better get back to me soon.You have my case number.You have my name, phone number, and email.If Lenovo is for "Those Who Do" then what you need to DO is start making up for what you DON'T DO.So do something right for once and call me.This laptop has not only cost me time and money, but now it's cost me my patience.

it was a bust for me, I'm sure it would work for someone else but it wasn't for me !!!!!

So, I won this thing on the Acer A Day Give Away. (So - I might be a little biased, cause they just gave me a free computer.)I was sort of in the market for a new laptop, and I really was not looking for a ultrabook. I'm more of a big clunky machine with a  big screen and all the bells and whistles type of guy.Imagine my surprise when I got this thing and have found that I really, really like it. I don't have an issue with the noise, nor do I mind the lack of CD drive. I think the start up time is fast, and the laptop overall is a great little machine. It feels really sturdy to me, despite the light weight. I really like that it does not get hot... like, at all. I had it running on battery power for nearly 4 hours the other day, shut it off, and felt the underside. It was tepid.I read reviews before I got the laptop that the keys were an issue. Some people complained about the keys not having the right amount of heft, which caused them to miss keys, or were unable to hit the arrow keys. Again, I like big things. Big keyboards included. That said. I don't have an issue, at all with the keyboard. I've not had any problems with the arrow keys. In fact, my only issue so far is that there are no dedicated function keys. There are function keys, but they're not dedicated (That is - I'd like to have a volume control, playback controls for video, etc.)I'm a big fan of the multitouch trackpad. I love that I can use gestures to make stuff happen. Took me a while to figure out how to use them correctly, but now that I have, I'm enjoying it. My only complaint is that you cannot create your own gestures, and can only use a predefined list of finger motions to trigger a predefined list of actions -- at least, using the stock software (I do not know of alternate software at the moment).Beyond that, it came with a lot of bloatware. Easily fixed, but a minor annoyance.___________________Edit: Exactly one year to the day after I received this thing, the trackpad stopped functioning properly and I cannot penetrate ACER's paywall to their warranty support. Absolutely no one has helped me with this. They're being very, very unhelpful and that has completely changed my opinion of this product.I would not buy this computer again, nor would I have any future business dealings with ACER because of their (obviously) well timed product failures, and refusal to help their customers.

I bought the laptop for $799 on Amazon.com around Jan 2012. After it arrived, it worked OKAY. The track pad was not nearly as responsive as in a larger laptop, or in a MacBook Air, but no big deal.  I can adjust to that, and I did.  But there were significantly worse problems.First problem - Defective Wireless Card. (See also, e.g., the 2-star review by "The Inveterate Scofflaw 'J'").  On random occasions, perhaps once every one to three hours of use time, the wireless adapter just goes out.  *POOF*  No, it is not that I went out of network range, etc. Rather, the computer acts as if I had manually disabled the wireless, and there is nothing that can be done to bring it back.  Rebooting will work, and I realized later that putting the computer to sleep, which takes much less time, will also cure the nuisance. So I have had to do that, usually once every several hours, randomly, whenever the wireless card craps out on me. This was not a big deal, as it usually takes no more than 10-15 seconds total to put the computer to sleep and wake it up.  The quick sleep-awake response, to be fair, is a nice aspect of this computer.Second problem - Defective Hard Drive. (See also, e.g., the 1-star review by "frank"). About one month after getting this computer, I was using it on the train when all of the sudden I got a blue screen. Upon reboot, I keep getting an error message and windows will not boot. I google the error message, and learned that it was indicative of hard drive failure, and that other people whose laptops sustained a physical impact have had that message.  My computer never fell.  As a result of this, I shipped the computer in to Acer, and they ended up replacing the hard drive (just as I figured). So all my data was lost. Not a big deal, I only had it for a month, but still, but be warned!My computer arrives in two weeks or so, and the invoice says that a new hard drive was installed. So far so good, but one day later, the computer starts doing clicking sounds randomly, and then I get a blue screen. Upon reboot, the clicking sounds (which are annoying an scary, think about fingernails on chalkboard) continue and I get an error message about have no boot drive.Conclusion: This computer was a bad decision, and the problems discussed herein are likely a product of Acer trying to use sub-par technology in an ultra-thin laptop. MacBook Air laptops, for example, all have solid state drives -- no disk drives. I think having an actual disk drive in such a thin computer is asking for trouble. Similar issues may have been with the poor contact between the wireless card and the mainboard.At any rate, I am happy that Amazon.com has a very easy return policy for defective computers.

I bought this notebook NOV 2, 2011. It was OK and actually I liked it very much.Then JAN 17, 2011 I notice the notebook acts strange, it looks like hardware error.Called ACER service and they have me a few instruction, but basically reboot the notebook.Around March 15, I had same stange freeze again, did same with ACER Service and reboot.And finally today, the notebook makes hugh noice from hard drive, of course freeze, it is surly looks like hard drive error.Called ACER service again, long talk.ACER service is saying the notbook is 1 year warrny, but software is 6 month warranty, so I have to purchase extended warranty which is $299, and they will not service my notebook unless I purchase this extended warranty. And I think even thought I buy this extended warranty, problem will be same.I claimed ACER service why should I buy extended warranty while it is not even 6 month yet. But ACER siad "NO"So I called Amazon and explained all over.Amazon was very freindly and suggested me to return the notebook for 80% refund.I will return this ACER notebook tomorrow.I have another one of same notebook which still works fine.I think if you buy ACER, try to pick up good one.ACER WARRANTY is make you pay more money for NOTHING.Well they have guts to say "NO" to the customer for warranty service.Good Luck ACER !!!

I ordered this laptop for my girlfriend in July 2012, it is now December and the LCD needs to be replaced, Now I need to ship it to Acer for repair.

Although I don't usually comment on products, this piece of garbage pushed me to the wall. It is by far the worst laptop I had so far. With owning it for about 10 months now, it runs slower than my old inspiron 6400 dell (which still functions perfectly but old). The battery doesn't last up to 30mins anymore, the mouse is the worst ever. Why be an apple wanna-be if you can just function well being your old self. This is a piece of ish, I might put it out on the curb for trash, or jus give it out for -100 bucks... please don't buy this CRAP. I would rate it as a -5 if d bar was here.

After an year, (a month out of warranty) the laptop just shows a white screen. The display cable is apparently torn!! Acer wants me to ship the laptop for repair - will cost me 300$! :(This seems to be a fairly common problem .. I have met two other people who faced the same issue with an acer ultrabook. Don't buy it!

This computer is definitely not worth the money. It broke just before my warranty was over. I sent it in to acer and the hard drive was replaced. It worked for another 2 weeks and died again. Another problem with the hard drive. Now since the warranty expired in the mean time, I wasn't even able to contact acer anymore without paying a high fee. I decided to order the recovery cds instead which weren't included and didn't help either. I am still trying to fix it but no success so far. So much trouble for a computer that was quite expensive and barely lasted through the warranty. I will not buy another product from acer!

I purchased this computer in April of 2012, it is now November of 2012 and I am sending it back for the second time to be repaired. Both times the computer would not boot up, and explaining this to the customer service reps that know english as a second language is very difficult. This may have been the last PC I ever buy. My next computer purchase will be an Apple. Save your money, time, and frustration, DO NOT BUY an ACER, and certainly not this one!

it is unfortunate that i've had similar problems with alex (1 star review)it was a nice and light laptop. thin, sleek. many people complain about the cheap feel or (see youtube) build but this wasn't an issue for me. i really really liked it.unfortunately, the first issue was wifi connectivity. within an hour or two of usage at home, my connection cuts off so i had to restart my laptop. the funny/weird thing was that ever since i had connectivity issues with my laptop, my roommate also had connectivity issues (maybe the card transmits and jams the signal? i don't know for sure...) but this was something i could live with. anyway, rebooting the laptop is a very very quick process (no exaggeration)!the second issue was that when i turned it on to watch netflix, my laptop took more than an hour to turn on. previous to this, it was working normally, so what happened was just bizarre to me. windows was trying to fix itself and then it later resumed normal operation. that same night i made sure to reboot it to see if this issue would occur again but to my relief at the time, it was working well again. however, the morning after, the same issue surfaced again. i was advised by the acer support team to perform a recovery; however, this didn't work out so well either. the recovery failed. the os was supposed to be stored within a partition in the hard drive but upon recovery, it couldn't access it anymore. i just didn't want to go through the hassle of buying the cd and a cd drive to try to fix something that got broken within a month.if you are the owner of a working acer aspire s3, that's great. it's just unfortunate that i received a defective product.

This is a piece of crap, breaking down 18months after purchased, and warranty expired.  Upon checking, it turns out many people have the same problem, that is White Screen cause by a cheap LCD cable, which by the way cause $120 to replace.  Don't buy this garbage.

I went through numerous RMA's and send back to Acer for repair.  I had nothing but trouble with each person I dealt with with Acer and the place I purchased this (newegg)  I had always had good luck with newegg before and since.  But this unit kept getting hot.  It did absolutely no gaming without overheating.  They kept saying it must be a bad unit, but they never fixed it, and they never offered to replace it.  I have gotten maybe 20hrs use out of it so far and the warranty is almost out now.  I will never buy another Acer computer again.  Sorry for the rant, good luck if you purchase this unit.

Times like this you wish Amazon would allow you to give ZERO STARS.  Right after warranty expired I started to get 2 to 3 blue screens of death per day.  Acer would not help --trying to get any support from their website is an exercise in frustration.

For $800 this was the worst purchase I have ever made. The quality of this ultrabook is complete s***. I honestly wish I would have paid $200-$300 more to get a higher quality ultrabook. Where to start....the sound quality is awful, and at full volume is not very loud so you will always need earbuds. The picture quality is terrible, if I take a picture of myself or chat with someone on skype it is noticeable that the picture is unclear and the color is distorted as if there is a filter on it. After one month of use the finish on the keys had already started wearing off and the mouse pad started sticking on one side. The display half of the ultrabook wobbles so much while you type it will make you dizzy. And the build is just plain cheap...there is a strip of black plastic at the connection between the display and the keyboard parts that has already cracked right in the middle...nothing happened so I guess it was from simple handling.The product looks really nice when you see it online...but when you take it out of the box you might be disappointed, and with a couple of months of use you will surely be really disappointed. Get something else.

I enjoyed my S3. It was so much more portable than my old, big laptop. That was in the past tense because my S3 just wouldn't start this morning. No lights, nothing. Dead. It is less than six months old. To have a computer fail after six months is a sign of poor quality to me. Sending it to Acer for repair. I fully expect that they will find something that gets them off the hook from doing the repair under warranty (I'm sorry sir, but you were using your S3 while breathing. That is clearly a violation of the warranty terms.) I hope they prove me wrong.

I bought one from staples for less than %600 and thought it was a good deal. However, its hinge broke after a bit over 30 days. Now I cannot return it. They have no local technical services. You have to mail it in and there is no guarantee they will fix it: they often make up excuses to avoid their warranty. So I am afraid.

What a major led down.  I saw mostly rave reviews here and decided to give it a try.  There's really no point to go into the positives if the most basic functions like the keyboard and mouse pad are not usable.Keyboard:I read about the potential "getting used to" on the keyboard but didn't realize it's that bad.  Certain keys would not register UNLESS you have to be precise on the where your fingers land on the keys.  This seems to affect certain keys on the keyboard.  So imagine if you're a fast typist like me and constantly second guessing yourself on which key you hit and or you will need to constantly go back to correct yourself.  This is just insane. If you havfe carpal tunnel syndrome don't even consider this laptop. The keyboard was so bad that I had write this review on my desktop, it was just that frustrating.Mouse Pad:The mouse pad is a single piece design and it's integrated with the left and right button.  The problem is that it's big enough where you accident hit the right side and right click appears accidentally.  Seems to be better with the tap click featured disabled but it's not really a true solution. Also, mouse clicks is not as sensitive as it should be so you need to press harder.  I found highlighting text very difficult and you have pay extra attention to get the job done.Other issues (not a showstopper but I personally didn't' like)Build QualityThe build quality is on the cheap side, so look like an Apple Mac Air it's certainly doesn't feel like one.  The case shell feels more plastic than alloy. If you seen the Mac Air you can easily feel the difference.  Granted the Air book is about double the price of this ultrabook so just want to clear up some expectation.Screen resolutionDepending on what you used in the past this may or may not be a problem for you.  At first I thought the resolution won't be an issue since it's a smaller 13.3" inch screen and found the display space is not adequate for my needs using the native resolution/lcd size combo.Screen viewing angleIt seems like I have play with the view angle on this laptop more to get it right otherwise it's appears to be washed out towards the bottom of the screen.  This is annoying since it's not the normal viewing angle and you have to push the LCD more back to get it right.Sound systemIs this just a gimmick with this "Professional" tuned Beat Audio thing?  I found the sound horrible almost sounding like mono.  I have a 5 year Lenovo T61 with better audio.  Perhaps this is due to the fact the the speakers are at the bottom of the laptop which makes it sound muffled.  This is also a horrible place to place the speakers.  Why not place facing you at the LCD?I paid $599 for a refurb shipped.  I would probably kept it if it weren't' for the keyboard and keypad.  This is the basics for any computer, how could Acer screw this up (so bad)?

I bought this laptop today after looking at it online. Right out of the box, it was nothing but trouble. The automatic update failed to update the usb ports so that nothing I plugged into them worked. I was on the phone with support for almost two hours trying to figure out that I needed new drivers. And Windows 8??? OMG that is the worst program I have ever seen. After spending the day doing things on it, I'm ready to pull what's left of my hair out.But the reason I'll be hauling myself down to the store and begging them to take it back and refund my money is that the power and usb ports are on the back of the machine, not on the side like they are for every other laptop I've seen. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but if you plan on using your laptop in bed or snuggled up on the sofa, anywhere that your body might come in contact with the back, forget it. It joggles the usb connections, making the attachment continuously unload and reload. The power cord has a small transformer close to the plug and it addition to the cord getting tangled up underneath the computer, I was constantly having the thing sit down wobbly because I sat it onto the desk and the transformer was under there. Continuous PITA to try and remember to pull the cord out of the way before setting it down on a surface. The port placement is completely impractical. The designers obviously didn't try to actually use the thing in daily life.Avoid this thing like the plague!

I bought an Acer Aspire Pc 6 months ago and the dvd burner has went out. I spent hours today on the phone with them having me to factory reset my computer (they had to look it up to find out how that was done and I was already in the process of it being restored before they said go to start menu. It took me a couple of hours to remove stuff from my computer to my external (and i probably missed some stuff) plus i have to reload all my programming that the restore deleted. This would absolutely fix my dvd burner.......of course it didn't. Than i had to call back and I talked to another CRS to have him keep repeating (rudely)First he said i had to send my whole computer in, i refused, I had read too many bad reviews of people sending their whole computer in and the company saying it was banged up in transport and they had to have $200 to fix the cosmetic problems before they would fix internal problems. When I refused and asked for a new dvd burner sent to me with a return postage sticker so i could send my old one back he told me I had two options they could take my credit card number and put a hold of $150 and they could send out me out a new dvd burner and if i sent the other one back (like i have use for one that doesn't work) or I could send mine in and they would send me a new one out........I told him that that was unacceptable. I asked for his supervisor and the supervisor (another very condescending and rude person) would only repeat the same thing. I asked to be transferred to his supervisor and was told he answered to no one, and hung up on me. Than i called back and they had me uninstall and reinstall my dvd burner and that was a guarantee fix. It wasn't. I am at wits end what to do. I have read way to many reviews of people sending their stuff in and never getting it back and I will not pay $150 for something that you can buy in the store for around $50 and to top that off the way they run their business i would never give them my credit card number. They are the most unorganized and rude company it has been my misfortune to meet. Do Yourself a favor.......DO NOT BUY ACER PRODUCTS!!!!

The noise of the fan is awful. I cant stand it. Dont be as stupid as i have been. Do not purchase this laptop !!!!

Inspite of being soooo good and attractive in its looks, this laptop failed when it comes to hardware... I ordered one and that had a malfunctioning trackpad... When connected to an HDTV through HDMI, the trackpad went crazy... I sent that back and ordered for a replacement and that the same prob  and some more.. The spacebar was not correctly responsive... The bluetooth never worked properly... I felt soooo pissed and returned the item.. I have a netbook of acer that has been performing really well over the past two years and after buying this laptop, I ve lost respect for ACER.. I guess the entire electronic industry is now more of managers and less of engineers... that is y u get attractive products but not performing ones for a good price...ON THE WHOLEACER S3 tried to make it early and will prob leave earlier than expected...BAD HARDWARE INTERFACE...

i receive my acer aspire s3 via ups. rush home turn it on set it up and then did a windows live update . the computer crash it would not boot up.i got a "disk read error occurred" i called acer and they try to help me but at the end they told me i had to send it for repair because it would not recovered... i told then i just got it ? WTF.. i dont know if i recommend this item to anyone but all i know is that i want my money back.

I had high hopes for this computer, but it has given me nothing but trouble. I've had it for a year and a half now. During the first year, the computer went through a phase where it would just shut down for no reason. The sound card would also turn off intermittently, as would the sound control. The battery died the day the warranty expired. I'd been having trouble with the CD player for a while, but it would play some CD/DVD if I got lucky. I didn't use it that often. Now the CD drive is not working at all, and none of the fixes suggested in the support pages work.The cover also gets very easily scratched.

This computer gave me SO many problems. While I was pleased when I got it, this computer absolutely caused me to hate technology. I dealt with problems ranging from the soundcard to the wireless adapter to adobe flash. Better yet, over its 1 and a half year life I had to replace the hard drive, the ac adapter, battery, AND motherboard. I don't know that much about computers, but I know that's plain wrong. If you are lucky enough not to have the same problems I did, that's great. However, you'll probably still be disappointed with the meager battery life, the trackpad, and the customer support from HP.

Its been 6 months now since my husband brought one. There are many things I dislike in this laptop1. The keys are flimsy and started coming out in just a few months. 2 keys are totally damaged (including spacebar :( )since they don't even latch in place.2.  Battery stays on for just 30 mins3. Ever since we owned it, we are having difficulty with the touch pad. I have tried various settings but either they react especially while typing, or they don't react at all.4. Ours have windows 8 and its a steep learning curve because of all the nuances. Sidebars and full screen opened apps keep popping up while using touch pad.Its too inconvenient

It was cheap so bought it for Black Friday. However, the mouse pointer jumps when least expected while tapping. Its quite slow. Its not dual or quad core.keyboard is not too bad.display contrast as with dell is not great.

very heavy laptop...difficult to carry with one hand. the weight should be specifically mentioned. it weighted almost 4 kg. disappointed

I've had this laptop for a month and a half. After minimal use, only for email and photos at this point, the thing stopped working completely.  It doesn't even power up.  I can't return it because the deadline passed a few weeks ago.  $600 for nothing!!! It is the worst product/ experience I've ever had with Amazon.  I took a gamble buying a laptop online, and it failed me. I don't care what positive experiences others have had with this product, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Very, very upset and disappointed.

Hp laptops work well when they are working, but be forewarned - they do not last.  The motherboards get hot and burn out.  It is not worth the money to fix/replace a motherboard.  There is no response from HP on their support site regarding this issue and HP continues making them.  Before buying any HP, please look at the problems encountered with this issue.  Count on this notebook lasting one year.

This computer was dead out of the box. It was returned for credit. I would avoid this item unless you enjoy returning faulty items.

Customers service is a crapI bought this laptop few months ago,and i think it was the worst decision that i had made in my life,the screen get cracked spontaneously, and Sony refused to repair it.they have the worst customer service.i am not gonna buy any Sony product again.

I bought a Sony VAIO computer (not this model) 11 months ago and when it stopped working Sony initially had a repairman come by to try and repair it and he couldn't, so he had me send it in to the company. Now they say it has been damaged and for them to repair per "agreement" it will cost me $470. The initial repairman said nothing about damage but all they say is that "Our tech says there is damage and it is not covered".  Really!! Damage all of a sudden appeared even though it was not working before and you don't acknowledge that  So all I can say is, DO NOT BUY ANY SONY VIAO COMPUTER.  I am now looking at buying another computer since I definitly am not paying to get that computer back and have another problem to go though this again.  It is just a wasted initial purchase of over $600 that I made, but don't make the same mistake.  We are mailing the "damaged" computer to the President of Sony Electronics in San Diego for a paperweight.  Stay away from Sony.  If I can help someone else avoid that problem then maybe that is why this happened to me.

I have had mine for 4 years and the warranty just expired in those years I had 9 hard drive failures the mother board had to be replaced the cooling system replaces twice the cd  rom replaced and the biometric reader replaced twice. It had never been dropped  and sat on my bed on a laptop table. it has been a nightmare I have had two other dells that I loved a inspiron 1501 and dell inspiron 1520 so I was happy to purchase another from dell but from now on i plan to purchase older laptops that were before dell started making there laptops so light and cheap.

Wow!  So frustrating!  Just spent 48 minutes on my now 4th call to Dell "Custormer Care", who doesn't seem to care (or have the ability to care), at all! Dell Driver Download Manager updated the software for the fingerprint reader on my Vostros 3550 laptop, and now it doesn't work. I called Dell to see if I could get the previous version of the software, but Tech Support's owner registration info doesn't match what Customer Care has. I registerd the laptop in my name when I purchased it new from BestBuy (BestBuy bought it from Buy.com. I have no idea who they buy from...)  Now Customer Care is telling me to contact  "them" to see if I can find out who purchased the computer! I PURCHASED THE COMPUTER AND REGISTERED THE COMPUTER THE DAY I BOUGHT IT! I HAVE THE RECEIPT'S AND MASTER PACKING SLIP FROM BUY.COM, but according to Dell, I don't own it!  Customer Care won't tell me who "they" are (the people I'm supposed to contact that it is supposedly registered to), but expects me to contact "them" to straighten out the registration. Also told me that my warranty is invalid until I get Dell's error straightened out!  Dell's records concerning the registration of my computer are in error, but they expect me to correct it by contacting an unknown entitiy.  Need to rename 'Customer Care' to, 'We just don't/can't care'!  Service Request #: 859372101 (KMM141813026V3810L0KM)

Why would you pay this much money for an OLD version of this laptop? You can buy a much newer M17x from Dell with the next gen processor, bigger hard drive, and better video card for less than this!

I have owned this laptop for about 8 months at this point.  Let me tell you that is by far the fastest laptop I have ever used.  It handles most games with ease at full graphics.That being said there is a major flaw with this laptop.  Within 2 months of owning the laptop, the keys started popping off.  Dell does have a picture tutorial on how to put this keys back on, but if you follow the tutorial it will often lead to adjacent keys popping off.  And if you push too hard when trying to get the keys to latch, then you are out of luck.  Luckily my first experience with Alienware customer service ended in a keyboard replacement in less than 2 days from calling tech support.  However when it started happening again tech support was not that helpful.  I was told I would need to purchase a replacement keyboard for $110!  The laptop is under warranty for 4 more months.  I was even considering extending the warranty.My suggestion is to use the built in keyboard as little as possible.  I use a logitech keyboard now, my biggest issue is now the laptop does not really travel easily anymore.

this computer is a complete waste of money total junk after 2 months the battery dont charge very slow keys fall off  the back light does not work and more

This piece of junk is the worst machine I've ever had to deal with.  Microsoft Updates hangs the machine up in a "Failed to configure updates" loop and it's all but impossible to get it out.  I can't even safe start because the hangup is somewhere in the BIOS.  I have managed to work around it with an Ubuntu boot USB that confused the Asus enough to get me to the repair screen.  Fortunately, the first time I had this catastrophe I made a restore point and and was able to restore back it (yesterday).  It's not a week old.  Here's the thing: YOU CAN'T INSTALL ANY UPDATES!!!  What-a-piece-of-#$@!

I purchased this laptop recently thinking that it would be a satisfactory replacement for my HP G60 laptop that has been suffering from the blue-screen-of-death, however, my experience with this product has been abysmal. First, the Windows 8 OS that comes with this computer doesn't function correctly - some apps simply will NOT open. I attempted to open the Store App to see if I could update to Windows 8.1 and every time I received an error message stating, "cannot connect to the server, please try again in a few minutes." (when I was CLEARLY connected to the Internet since I was browsing the web on IE and Mozilla Firefox while I was trying to access the application). I should also note that the optical disk drive was faulty and wouldn't close completely. You literally have to HOLD the disk drive in so that the PC can read from the DVD, disc, or any other form of media of your choosing. Unfortunately, I had to hold the disk drive IN as I was installing the software that accompanied my wireless mouse; a highly unpleasant experience. I also kept encountering a myriad of pop-up ads and spam as I browsed the web using Firefox (I'm not sure why since I had Norton 360 installed on my computer and pop-ups disabled). Despite having antivirus software installed, I still came across a vast array of annoying pop-ups and advertisements. This is most likely not attributed to Firefox nor Norton since I am currently using both on my desktop computer and they work just fine. The web browsing experience on this PC was relatively slow and distasteful. This PC also did not come with Adobe Flash Player pre-installed (although I'm not entirely sure if it's supposed to but nonetheless I found it to be a nuisance to actually search it up and install it myself). The touchscreen monitor worked well, although it should be noted that the aforementioned negative qualities of this product greatly surpass the presence of the monitor.All in all, a very, very bad product and I would not recommend it by any means. DO NOT BUY. I'd much rather recommend an HP product or a MacBook. This is the FIRST time I purchased a notebook PC from ASUS and thus far I am sorely displeased with the quality of Windows 8 and the hardware itself. Again, I strongly urge any readers and potential buyers not to buy this product.

This laptop is awful, it is always lagging and having malefactions. The screen has cracked 3 times out of no where. I absolutely do not recommend this laptop to anyone for its horrific qualities.

We recieved a out of warrenty 2011 mac with severe screen artifacts. Returned it and have yet to get any feedback.

Bought it in January 2013. On March 10 the screen failed without any physical damage done to it.Called Toshiba and explained the problem. The technician instructed me to send the computercomputer to Toshiba Repair Depot (cost $25.00) to be fixed. Upon receiving the computer, Toshibainformed me that their warranty did not cover damaged screen. First of all, the screen was not damaged,it simply failed to perform. Second, why did the technician instructed me to send the computer for repair?The compute cost me $365.00 at Amazon.Toshiba Repair Depot offered to fix the problem as follows:Cost of the repairs (all amounts are USD)Parts:  $ 206.95  (LCD Panel)Labor: $60.00Total:  $ 266.95Plus:  $25.00 already paid for shippingTotal  $291.95I declined their offer, of course. Contacted Screendoctors.com and bought aa brand new replacement screen ($81.00 + 14.53 shipping = $95.53 total), including the toolsneeded to do the repair (that's 1/3 of what it would cost me to have laptop fixed by Toshiba).And the replacement screen comes with a two year warranty - which Toshiba does not eve offer.Shame on them!!! I will never buy another Toshiba product again and will spread the word around.

I returned this laptop as quickly as I could. I realize it is low end, but I was hoping for something a little less, well, plastic-y feeling. And Windows 8 is terrible. Save yourself and buy a machine with any other operating system.

I love my mac but really sad I was lied to and payed more money for something I did not received.I ordered this mac, and today looking on the Graphics Coprocessor and saw I had a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M 256MB instead of the Graphics Coprocessor NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT 512MB, and don't know if I could trust amazon again in an important purchase.Feeling betrayed.

Had hard time switching between two OSs.  Turned out tablet is shorting out somehow.  Sent it to ASUS, they sent it backed 'fixed'. Worked for a while, then same problem.  Great while it works, but very disappointing.  With display not working, can't do anything with it.

I received this Notebook/Tablet and it did not work....  I sent it back to ASUS for repairs....  60 Days later...  They still can not tell the problem with it or when I will be getting it back!!!  This is the worst company I have ever tried to get information or a working product from!  If you want something that works or a company with integrity.....  Look else where..

Well, I loved this for about a week or two, but it failed to meet my expectations.  I seem to also have the screen issues others complain about; which sucks, because I bought it for a trip so I could have a computer and camera....and now that I'm on the trip, I need to use a different computer because I cannot get the display working.  I have to wait 2-3 weeks until I return home to call Asus and complain, then based on the online discussion they want me to send it in for service...so who knows when I'll see it again, if I'll get any of my data off of it, or if they just give me a new computer and I lose my data, or if they'll fix it and it'll happen again.  Not to mention being out a bunch of money and laptop while I wait.

Bought this laptop and was fairly happy with it until just over a month after I bought it it wouldn't boot up.  I tried all the hard resets and bios boot ups and nothing worked.  At least customer service didn't waste my time, they issued an RMA quickly and now I am waiting to hear back from the repair center.  All laptops can have problems but it seems so cruel to start having problems just after the 30 day return policy expires.

This computer has great specs, which is why I was so surprised that the screen was an average, run-of-the-mill matte screen.  I have matte screens at work, so the real issue was the quality of graphics.  It was not sharp at all.  I had bought this powerful laptop because it could handle video editing.  Who wants to edit a movie on such a mediocre screen?

Computer Dead on arrival.  Blue screen of death...  Going to have to return this which is extremely frustrating.  Buyer beware.

Bluetooth did not work, it took 2hrs to update....very touchy, slightest finger movement caused all kinds of issues, had it less than 8 hrs sending it back.  My 1gen i3 toshiba works better.

FYI, I am reposting my review of ASUS laptops here because I want to spread the word. This has nothing to do with Windows 8. Both asus computers I have are Windows 7. Having said that, here is my reposted review.i have two ASUS laptops. They are the worse piece of crap I've ever owned. ASUS makes good motherboards as i have one in my desktop computer and it works great. But both ASUS laptops have had many problems. I sent one into ASUS and it took weeks to get it back. The same problem emerged within a short period of time. ASUS refused to replace the computer with a new one. They will only try to fix the garbage you're stuck with. Both computers were rebooting themselves right in the middle of important work. One has slowed down so much, I finally gave up and ordered a HP laptop. That will be my second HP. I don't work for HP and don't make a dime by mentioning them but the hp laptop I currently have has been working great for four years and has been very stable. That's why I just recently ordered another one. So...STAY AWAY FROM ASUS LAPTOPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After running updates to the laptop I was informed by Microsoft that the operating system was stolen.  The lap top will no longer work.

Received pc before delivery day. When I turned it on it worked at that time. After a couple of times it stopped working completely.  Sent it back. Did not like at all. Will not buy from them again.  JO

This laptop is wonderful at first. About 8-13 months later your doomed. You montior will go out and the laptop is made with a defective chipset that was recalled by Intel, but Samsung still sells the laptop. You can google Samsung NP-QX411-W01US monitor issues and find so many utube videos and articles about the monitor. With thinner laptops available these days its better to buy something else. When this laptop came out it was a very good one buy the hardware details and it will play hardcore video games but it wont last long enough to get your money worth and the manufacture warranty will not cover any thing. If I would have paid less than $500 maybe I would feel like 1 year is not bad but I recieved it as a gift years ago and the price was well over $1000 bucks. It was way before its time but the screen didnt last over its time. I'm sorry but I probably will not buy or even take as a gift another Samsung laptop. Its beautiful but its insides are worthless. Now I have to buy another monitor to replace the defective screen but with the chipset being an issue I'm sure the motherboard will burn out right after I replace the monitor. At this point I hate to say it but its boardline Dell quality and Dell sucks.

I have bought Samsung NP-QX411-W01US last summer. The hard drive was broken in a month. I have to spend money to ship it to TX to have it serviced. Now right after a year the screen stops working correctly. There are 3 bands on the screen with the center band completely white and the right band completely dark. From the link below you can see that this is a systematic problem that happened to a lot of users. Because it is just passed one year warranty period I have to deal with this on my own. I regret to have bought this trouble. My advice: Stay away from this and all of Samsung's products.[...]

This notebook has a nice appearance, but don't be fooled. If you plan to take your laptop on the road or use it with an external monitor, do not buy this product. The battery dies after 45 minutes of use after being fully charged; Samsung's claim of 9-hour battery life is completely bogus. I have tried a full discharge/recharge several times as suggested by Samsung customer service, but the problem persists.  The pre-loaded software is also buggy, particularly Samsung Display Manager and Samsung Recovery Solution.  Samsung customer service is also a big disappointment - technicians are not knowledgeable, and asked me to rebuild my system numerous times only to find that problems were not solved after hours of work.  My only option now is to ship the unit to Samsung for warranty service, leaving us without a computer for 2-3 weeks at a minimum, as Samsung does not provide a loaner computer during the service period.  Extremely disappointed - I will not purchase another Samsung product, ever.

I use to love the brand name Asus; however, after receiving this laptop...  I definitely dislike it with a passion. Barely bought a few months back and i'm already having so many problems. It gets really hot because of the fan and makes so much noise. It shuts off by itself sometimes. The screen flickers on and off for some odd reason.. Should I go on? I mean I still like some of Asus's products, but this one was not what I had expected at all. It could possibly be the people I bought it from, but still..

I am a tinkerer with a computer science degree -- so know how to get around tech issues.  Bought this for someone who is not extremely tech-savvy because of the mix of features (touch screen, fast bootup promise, windows experience).  This machine has given nothing but problems since the day it arrived.Was extremely slow out of the box.  Did not connect to wireless network.  Used windows store to upgrade to 8.1 and started working....very slowly.  A day or two later showed some message suggesting that he "refresh" to address the slowness.  From what I can see, the machine reset to factory settings.  Wireless down again, slow as molasses (1-2 and you're back on??  Must be geological time) and unable to activate windows.Called Microsoft who claim that due to OEM installation, they are unable to help and must call t.  Called ASUS and they say they will request Microsoft for key and the key will arrive (by email) after 24-48 hours!!!All I can say is Wow!  ASUS and Microsoft really know how to be competitive when consumers have a thousand choices.

I should have just bought a chromebook.  This is an overpriced machine.  Further, it is delivered with a bunch of needless software that slows everything down.  Finally, I get booted off the internet every time I use this machine.  EVERY TIME!  It is too expensive for what you get.

Laptop did not work when I received it.  Black screen, wouldn't turn on at all. Very disappointed as I was really looking forward to this delivery and was very excited about my much researched purchase. Amazon worked with me and did a great job on the return though.

I am so upset with this $600 purchase. Windows 8 is just straight awful. Asus restarts the computer daily and you can't get out of it, it is completely disruptive and takes forever. Video playback is poor. I find the keyboard frustrating, the touch screen aggravating due to the set up. I could just go on and on. I work at home on the computer constantly so I'm not one to just complain about what I don't know. What I do know, is that this is not user friendly and the software is unusable.

Was a very upset because its a Christmas gift. But what can you do? "NOTHING"!!! Product charged for two hours and when attempting to boot NOTHING!!! Lights come on NO PICTURE NO SOUND Black SCreen. Ordering a different product.. Shipping Speed was Outstanding!!! Sad my baby girll will not get her Christmas present from me unitl after Christmas.. This is the first time I have ever had to return any product I have received via Amazon. So I am still an amazon.com customer.

First of all, sorry for my English, it's not my mother language.On October 31, 2013, I bought an Asus VivoBook S500CA in Adorama Store, NY, during my vacation. Back to my hometown, in Brazil, after few months of use, some problems: instability with wireless system, unexpected shutdown, loss of performance, noise in sound system, damaged touchpad. On January 14, I made my first contact with Asus Customer Service. The first answer suggested me to contact international service because my product was bought in US an I could not ask for warranty in Brazil. After a few complaints in specialized websites, they accepted to receive my Vivobook for warranty repair.On February 22, I received a message saying that my notebook had been sent back to me, but no tracknumber was sent. On February 25, I received another message from Asus telling me that there were a problem during repair or delivery and they were going to make a refund to me. Considering I had a prior message telling me that product had been sent, I understood that my notebook had a problem during delivery and was lost. So, at first, I accepted to receive a refund. But, Asus is offering a refund less than the amount paid, because they are not considering the taxes I paid after. Also, the document they sent to me is saying that the computer is in possession of the company and that I asked for the refund. That is not true! They didn't give me the option of receiving a new model of the same product. After my complaints, I was informed they don't have the same model (of a new product highlighted in Asus website) or similar to offer.I'm very disappointed with Asus products and Customer Service. When I bought it, I considered it was a good choice, because they have a Customer Service in Brazil and it was highly recommended at the store. Now, I don't have a notebook for more than 2 months and I'm not sure if I'll receive the money back. In a Brazilian website for complaints, I can see I'm not the only one with the same kind of problem.So, I'm here to let you know what kind of problem you can get if you buy (please don't do it!) an Asus.

After loading Microsoft Office Professional 2010 + Microsoft Security Essentials I began receiving messages from Microsoft that the version of Windows 7 was not authentic and that Security Essentials would shut down in 30 days in addition to automatic updates all failing. A little phrase above the time on the lower right of the screen appeared and stayed there: "not an authentic version of Windows 7". Since I had already loaded MS office professional 2010(a very expensive program)I was forced to buy an authentic version of Windows 7-and load the authentic product key- BRINGING THE TOTAL COST TO WELL OVER $400.Over a month later this PC is full of qwirks.DONT BUY FROM DISHONEST SELLERS LIKE THESE PEOPLECOMMUNICATIONS WITH THE SELLER REVEALED THAT HE IS BARELY LITERATE.The Amazon claim process is 99.9% automated and individual issues are not well addressed.I would not want to return a pc after I loaded MS office and was forced to buy an authentic version of Windows 7. That would be returning a much more valuable product than the one I bought.I requested a refund for the authentic version of Windows 7. The automated return process is not set up for specific requests and only offered a return.ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH IT!!!!

Bought this one because I need a light one when I travel this summer. However, the first time I got it it did not work. I thought the battery was out of charge and charged it for an hour but it still didn't turn on. Fortunately enough, after three days of charging I was able to turn it on when I was writing my final paper for the semester. However, that's the ONLY time I could use it. Once I turned it off it never comes alive, and two days before my trip I'm here typing this comment on my smartphone with anger and anxiety. For the only time it works I would say it deverses the price. High resolution, decent reaction speed, and most win8 characteristics available. BUT you have to PRAY that you are FORTUNATE enough to get it turned on for a few more times.

These things are a piece of junk.  We were given money to buy our sons computers for living and doing school in Africa - decided to go cheap rather than buying just one mac.  Bought them.  Within a month, the first one froze - couldn't do a thing with it.  Got it fixed.  Before a couple weeks passed, it crashed again - this time couldn't go on the internet.  Got it restarted to factory settings...again.  The other two just got updated, and now one of them has the same problem - can't go on the internet - and we didn't even go on the internet!  I will NEVER buy another pc as long as I live.  Total waste of money.  Asus claims that it "inspires innovation, persistent perfection" - what a joke.  I might find some innovative ways of demolishing the stupid machines but that's all the innovation that I can come up with.

This particular seller sold a computer that only worked for 31 days. Instead of doing the right thing he hide behind the amazon refund policy. He knew that computer was not working properly. I have a main computer that I used for work and rarely used the new because the purpose of the computer was a back up if my main computer stop wroking. Please do not purchase anything from this seller because he is hishonest.

had to return computer was defective upon arrival battery would not charge or retain power. returned to amazon for refund

The sound is horrible. If you like to listen music on your headphones, never buy this computer.  I picked it out because it had good processor specs for the price, but apparently they cheaped out in other areas to create a holiday bestseller. I honestly have never experienced sound this tiny on any laptop.  Toshiba support claims it's working fine... oh well.

I've run Windows and OSX for decades, but am baffled by this greasy mess.  It was a gift for my wife to replace her 5 yr old Dell (with 1/3 the memory and hard drive space).  In theory, there's  enough RAM and HD space, but this is laptop is a cow.  The battery won't charge, but that's a small matter compared to the bloated, fluffy garbage that comes pre-loaded.  It was a marathon just resetting it to the gross factory configuration for return.  A disappointment on every level.Added 3 months later:What DIDN'T mention is that I bought TWO of these at once.  As I said, the first was defective out of the box, but the other?  The left screen-hinge broke after 90 days.  That's two for two, and I wish there was a zero rating.  Glad to hear that many are having good experiences with these, but in 20 years of computers, I've never been so disappointed with a product.

You can plug headphones into a cell phone, and get great sound quality.  You can't, with this laptop.  I have never experienced anything like it.  Tinny, monotone sound, with NO volume.  Called the manufacturer and they refused to address the issue, and told me they couldn't help me.  If you're looking to use your laptop for any kind of media, stay away from this one.

Toshiba Laptop was the worst purchase I have made in a very long time. It came with Windows 8, which I hate. I replaced it with 7 but Geek Squd told me the keyboard was defective, as the cursor kept jumping back a space or two.I sent it to Toshiba repair, but they just reloaded windows 8 over my install and never replaced the keyboard. Sending it back again and then suing them in small claims court.

It did open a simple task  if it did only half screen. so many others issues like very slow I have high speed internet

I know this is a cheap laptop, but it would have been nice to use it for more than three months (light business and very little web use) before it crapped out.  Just a few weeks after I bought it, I had to restore it.  Then it worked decent for a month or so before I started getting hard drive failure warnings, and now it's kaput.  Luckily, they're replacing the hard drive and all I have to pay is shipping, but I shouldn't be sending off this item so soon.I don't recommend buying this.UPDATE: I spent twenty-five bucks for shipping with insurance to have the hard drive replaced.  The laptop arrived in the mail today, and after spending hours moving my files back to the laptop & reinstalling programs, I'm getting a blue screen telling me the PC ran into a problem and has to restart.  I've contacted Gateway support and requested a refund.UPDATE #2: Acer (apparently when I bought a Gateway, I was actually buying a disguised Acer) support tried multiple times unsuccessfully to fix my many problems with this computer, then asked me to send it in for repairs again.  I refused, as I am not investing another dime in this piece of junk.  They refused to give me a refund, so I asked for a new unit to replace this one, as it is completely useless.  They refused to do that as well.  "We do not offer refunds or replacements," they said.  I will never buy anything Gateway/Acer again, and I strongly discourage anyone else from doing so.

When I got this computer the windows 8 took a minute to get used to but I do like it. Have a little trouble with mouse pad being offset with the screeen and my big hands hitting it when i type. Download speed is a little slow to me compared to a friends HP laptop. Heres the big issuse I have. On the night of the second day having this, lines start appearing on the screen as if the screen is going down. Will call the shipper and see what they recommennd, but will most likely send it back and get an HP or Dell. This is too big an issue to have to deal with, but other than the screen acting stupid I do like it.Update on 10/28/13. On the 27th the mouse pad quit working, the cursor disappeared and I will be sending it back.

Broken straight out of the box. It would connect to the Internet, but it wouldn't stay connected. Everything else in my house connects just fine - Xbox, Wii, desktop computer, cell phones - but not this. Reinstalled driver and it said it couldn't find the wireless network card. It would still connect though...for a minute, or five or ten. Gateway is taking it back. Not worth the hassle

The computer stopped working a couple of weeks after I received it. I already sent a complaint to you and supposedly you are working on it.It is, according to a computer technician who checked it, a severe electrical problem, probably due to an accident. The computer has rough marks and a glued track on the bottom!!!I hope you would be able to take care of the problem. Thanks.Best wishes,Jose L. Martin, M. D.

This computer has so many problems, but the main problem is it has terrible wireless problems. I tried calling technical support and they I must have spent an hour on three different occasions and still not resolved the issue. This has to be hands down the worst computer I have ever owned and I owned an emachines that was rated as top ten worst computers ever made! I just sold the Dell to one of those online places that gave me way  less than what I paid for it. But I just want to wash my hands of this terrible computer.

Don't buy any computer with the Windows 8 operating system installed.  It was made for tablet-type products and is a complete, utter disaster for laptop and desktop applications.  I am a long-time heavy user of Windows products and, ironically, believe Windows 7 one of the best operating systems anywhere.  Windows 8 is more than frustrating, it is infuriating.  And don't think you can buy a computer with Windows 8 then just have Windows 7 installed as several close friends say this doesn't always work.  Your best bet is to buy a computer with Windows 7 already installed or go to Apple.

I was looking for a cheaper alternative to replace my aging MacBook Pro.  Fully understanding that I wouldn't be getting as high a build quality as an MBP (and hoping to save a bundle of money in the process), I pulled the trigger and ordered one of these.  It arrived dead, complaining there was no bootable device.  This probably happens a lot, because the packaging LeNovo uses is absolutely pathetic.  The laptop was shipped in a very flimsy box with the computer wedged in between a couple small pieces of styrofoam on either side of the notbook.  That's it. I'm pretty surprised that the computer didn't arrive with a few dents the way it was packaged.  Anyways, I called Lenovo support, and spoke with a gentleman who took my details, provided me a case number, and then attempted to transfer me over to another department for an exchange.  I was then bombarded by advertisements for a free $25 supermarket card and a free gas gift card by an automated system, then disconnected.  Confused by what had just happened, I called back the number I was given in case of disconnect and got the same advertisements.  It appears the LeNovo rep not only gave me the wrong number to call, but also transferred me over to the wrong number.  I called back the main support number, and spoke with a different guy.  He gave me a different number, and then transferred me.  While trying to enter in my number to the irritating automated system I was disconnected again.  I tried calling back the new number I was given, and it just rang forever with no answer.  So for the third time I called the main support number and actually ended up talking with the same person again.  He apologized and tried to transfer me in directly to the correct department, but was unable to do so.  Instead I was given yet another number to try.  By this point I had received a dead computer and wasted an hour just trying to talk to the right person.  Maybe the dead computer was a fluke, but there is just no excuse for the joke that LeNovo calls customer service.  Anyways, after an hour of a half of my life being hung up on on and waiting on hold, I had completely lost faith in Lenovo.  If this is the level of support offered to someone who was shipped a brand new dead computer, what is a regular warranty service call like?  When I finally spoke to someone who could help me, I said if you cannot ship me a replacement overnight then I would like to return the computer.  She said they do not ship replacements overnight.  I got an RMA number, sent the dead laptop back, and will be taking my business elsewhere. Hopefully they Lenovo won't botch the return like they have everything else.Update #1 7/1/12: Yep, they botched it, why am I not surprised? I ordered a bluetooth mouse with the computer, and it was set to ship a week or two after the laptop shipped.  When I told customer service that I wanted a refund on the defective laptop, the rep assured me that the mouse order would be canceled.  Well, I just received shipping confirmation on the canceled mouse order, and my credit card has been charged.  I'm still waiting for my refund on the laptop as well.Update #2 7/9/12: For those who are wondering, the computer was purchased through LeNovo's website, not Amazon. I really, truly wish I had bought this through Amazon, because I would have had my refund and been done with this weeks ago. If you must buy a Lenovo, go through Amazon or a retailer who has a reasonable returns process. I am just posting this review on Amazon for the benefit of others.  As of today I still have not received my refund from LeNovo for either the laptop or the mouse.  Last week I filed a complaint with the BBB. I received an email from the "Customer Advocate and Complaint Resolutions" department about 3 days later, but when I try calling the guy who emailed me he is never there.  Going though Lenvo "support" is a hopeless endeavor.  I sure hope Lenovo is enjoying the interest free loan they took out on my credit card.  What a racket!Final Update: Things got much better once the BBB was involved.  I finally got my money back after a month of waiting.

unfortunately I did not get to test this computer at some local store and got an idea about the screen quality before I bought it.on paper this computer has excellent specs for its size!!!! but the moment I turned the computer on, I noticed that the screen is very dark, and the colors off  :(  I played with the settings for hours and it did not help. I connected the computer to a monitor to see if it is the screen or the graphics card etc.  In a nutshell I concluded that it is the screen. I called the lenovo customer service, and after an hour of connecting to the computer and running tests remotely, I was told that "it is a new computer, with a new screen. it just comes with that (strange) coloring and brightness, and there is nothing they can do about it" . I sent it back to the seller, and lost $200 in the transaction for shipping and restocking fees etc.1- the screen that all y480 series come with, it is the cheapest screen I have ever seen2- if it was a faulty screen, then it was the lamest customer service I have ever experiencedother than the cheap screen it is a good computer ... if the customer service was helpful or if they could replace the screen I would have kept this computer. it has excellent specs for its size, but cheap screen coupled with cheap customer service made me change my mind about lenovo.It seems like PC companies are lowering their standards and competing with each other to produce the flimsiest disposable computers ever ... Unless you want a disposable computer, I would not recommend lenovo (except thinkpad series), hp, dell, compaq, asus, and even sony!!!

I bought this laptop, and at the same time purchased an SSD with the intent of upgrading the hard drive.Despite many attempts I could not install windows 8 with a clean install on the SSD.  I contacted Microsoft support and their team spent no less than 4 days attempting to install Windows onto the SSD with the brand new Y480 Ideapad.  After 2 days, the call center assigned me the best technician available at a tier 2 level of support.  The tier 2 technicians routinely perform about 10 Windows installations per day.  They usually take the most difficult install cases.  Using remote applications, they virtually monitored the entire install until boot.  They ultimately could not install Windows 8.  They concluded that the issue was my Lenovo laptop.I contacted Lenovo support.  I was continually disconnected from calls after waiting on hold for long periods of time (this happened 3 times).  Despite taking my phone number, none of the employees that I worked with called me back.  I escalated support to two supervisors and to the manager of the customer support - literally the person that sets procedures for receiving calls.During my calls, I discovered that there was a known issue with the Lenovo BIOS preventing users from making Windows 8 installs.  Despite acknowledging this, I was not offered any support or suggestions as to how I could solve the issue with the BIOS.  I was told that to receive any more assistance, I would have to pay for premium support from the software team.  The hardware staff was rude and not at all interested in actually supporting the Lenovo product.While this was going on, I read online forums and discovered a 'whitelist' maintained by the BIOS that only allows certain system configurations.  Based on my readings on the internet, I believe the whitelist limits upgrades to the wireless chip for example, to only a few manufacturers / products with a particular serial number.  Any other upgrade will not be integrated correctly by the system.  A forum even posted a non-whitelist version of the BIOS - though this is out of date and crashed someone else's computer.I speculate that the whitelist also has Windows activation codes that prevents clean installs of windows on the machine.Overall, this was a very frustrating experience.  Though I was never able to install Windows 8 on the SSD, I was able to use imaging software to backup and restore the HDD onto the SSD and essentially clone the hard drive (Not at all a straightforward process, I think due to particular configurations of this laptop).If I had to do this again, I would not have purchased this laptop, though it is very reasonably priced, and has great hardware...  The reason to buy from a large brand name like Lenovo (or anyone else - Dell , Toshiba , Apple, etc) is that when things go wrong, they support the product.Well the support is lousy.In the future, I would go with a small business laptop builder based on the internet.  Though these companies are smaller and don't have name recognition, I am certain that customer support would be MUCH better, there would be no weird proprietary black lists on the BIOS - I faced a similar issue with a Dell workstation I bought a couple years back related to a CPU upgrade, and I ignored my own advice from back then...  Generally small custom builders companies tend to be priced reasonably as they don't have a name brand to back them up - they may sell 'Sager' notebooks for example.  The name brands are irrelevant though, because all the internals are literally commodities.  And I would rather use a Sager motherboard without any tampering of the BIOS than a Lenovo / Dell computer with proprietary crap added to 'differentiate' their product.In the end, since I got the darn thing to work, I kept the laptop with my SSD, but definitely not dealing with this hassle again.

I purchased the Ideapad in September 2012 and after few days I noticed a portion of the screen cover was sticking out . I had to carefully close and open the lid fearing the entire screen cover might come out. I talked to the tech support guy and he told me that I need to send the laptop for repair and it will be done in 7 business days. This is the biggest mistake I've ever committed.. Believing his words. I had sent the laptop to the service center in Jan 2013 and since then i'm counting days.During the course of time I have made several phone calls to the support and all I hear is silly excuses. We don't know when you will receive your laptop and the thing that drove me nuts was they put my laptop on hold since the day they have received it. I was told I'd be getting a phone call from the service center to learn more about the issue but nobody called.Beware if you send your laptop for repair . Keep in mind the following.1. You will have to wait several days for the support center to work on your case.2. Lousy excuses from the customer service.3. You can only call the customer support to check the status of the repair. If you have any questions/concerns all they do is  send the request to the case manager and he will forward the request to the support center.4. You can check your status sure but you will not find any update.All you can do is sit and pray hoping you will get your laptop back someday.If you wish to endure all this you are at your own risk. For me I will NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM LENOVO IN FUTURE.

I guess this is a refurbished or used computer. It had all kinds of problems including not connecting to the internet and freezing. I would have to force it off as it would freeze in the shut down mode. I tried tech support and rebooted it. I erased everything off of it but it didn't fix the problem. Luckily Amazon is great at returns so back it went.

This product is terrible! I've had it about a year. It constantly over heats!!I can't even type a paper without it overheating and shutting down.

I purchased this item and received it in a timely manner.  However, 34 days after receiving it, the backlight was going out, etc.  I contacted seller and was told that it was over 30 days and I had to return it to the manufacturer.  When I contacted Lenovo, and gave them the serial number and model number, I was told it was a year old on December 28, 2012 so the year warranty had expired also.  I have no recourse for the issues with this computer and Amazon won't even assist me.  I've very disappointed in Amazon, and will not buy anything like this from them again.

Really wanted to get a another desktop, but my better half wanted a laptop. My 12 year old desktop still works great, just wanted something newer. We shopped around for awhile, and this had everything we wanted. Didn't really need it for anything to complicated, just internet, office, and xbmc for watching movies (It has an hdmi output which we had connected to our receiver).Took me a long time to get used to windows 8, but I was slowly coming around.After about a month, it started freezing about 3-4 times a week. Couldn't do anything except a hard reset with the power button. Tried just about everything, got rid of xbmc, got rid of acer apps, photos, everything. Finally decided to just reset the system from scratch. And, you guessed it, froze during that too.Just when I was going to send it in, it re-started, I put in all of my information again, started it up. Great. Went online to check my email.....and it froze again.Currently being sent back to Acer. If it comes back fixed without freezing, I will update and give back a star or two. But when my desktop I bought 12 years ago froze once (when the hard drive went after 8 years) and is still working great, I expected a little better than one month out of a brand new laptop. I am currently using that 12 year old computer to write this review. And its not freezing. After searching google and seeing the number of others with similar issues with Acer computers, I would never buy another one. Look elsewhere for your next computer.

After 1 month of light use of this laptop, the computer crashed. I had the one year Acer warranty and called them to get help, but they argued that the issue was due to a windows 8 software problem and could not help me. They wanted to charge me money to send a recovery CD to fix the issue.  Furthermore, they couldn't help me with recovering files.  Acer, if you're going to give warranties to your customers, don't say it's not your fault that a computer breaks after a month. Last time I will buy an Acer product.

Sent me a completely damaged computer with a password on it so I couldn't access it at first. When I wanted my refund they didn't apologize for sending the wrong one. They must have thought I was an idiot. The hard drive was 120 gb not 500gb, it wasn't running that software, it was a completely different model number, not the computer pictured, the ram and ghz were different and the computer was severely chipped and dirty

I am using this laptop for 2 years. This computer generates a lot of heat and time lag is occurred frequently. This is my second SONY laptop and will be last... There is an word in Japan that SONY will be out of order within 2 years.

I bought this laptop from Best Buy on February 6, 2010, shortly after it came out.  I have had nothing but problems with it and with Sony's technical support (technicians).  First, the technicians had no idea the laptop existed.  The day I bought the machine, I called to verify my warranty and three technicians at Sony told me I had only a one year warranty - it does actually have two years, and I think Sony finally knows this. The speakers have a terrible intermittent buzzing noise that is not helped by the driver update offered from Sony.  When questioning the difference between the software Vaio Messenger and Vaio Update, the Sony technician actually told me that Vaio Messenger was a bag, like a messenger bag.  The keyboard started squeaking 4 days after I bought it.  The touchpad is even defective.  Often the right click menu will pop-up without me clicking the right-click button.  Also the mouse jumps from one part of the screen to another.As far as the specs go, they look great on paper, but aren't any faster than a Core 2 Duo 2.1 GHz.  The automatic backlight on the keyboard only comes up for a few seconds before it goes out.  Firefox and Office 2003 will often stop responding.Sony technical support is terrible and I've often received conflicting information, sometimes from the same technician.  They have no idea that the Automatic Screen Brightness exists.  Every phone call I've made has been at least 30 minutes long and most are over an hour.  On March 24th I was offered on-site technical service.  Today is April 20th and I'm still waiting.  No one at Sony has even said "I'm sorry you're experiencing these problems."  Best Buy has offered to exchange the machine today and I am doing just that.You would do well to spend your money on a machine that works, isn't as expensive as this one, and with a company that actually cares about their consumer.

I like everything about this laptop, on paper. I was willing to pay a bit extra to get the vaunted "Sony reliability" Very shortly after one year of use, the computer stopped booting. Sony was no help. This will be my last Sony product.

I purchased this laptop two weeks ago from Bestbuy worth $1049 (package with Neatgear Push-to-Tv and Kaspersky Anti-Virus) to replace our 3 year old Dell Inspiron PC. My wife fell in love with the style which is similar to MacBook Pro. Initially, I don't have any issues with regards to the speed and performance which I expected considering that it has Intel Turbo Boost Technology. However, when I tried to manually install several of my applications into this laptop using CDs, there are times that the system doesn't detect the CD drive (even before I insert the CD). Whenever I encountered this issue, I just restarted the system and it all come back to normal. After that, my wife and I continued our "break-in" process by testing several apps, video streaming and playing music while surfing the net, chatting through skype etc... Then came the unexpected... Everytime we play music (either through CD or harddisk)/watching movie/making calls through Skpe, there's always a point where a squeking sound originates from the speaker. A distortive sound always takes place in random timings. We also not satisfied with the sound of the speaker in general. Even if we adjust the volume to its maximum value, you can barely hear the sound (add to the fact that the distortive sound still takes place). After three days, we decided to return it back even if we pay for the restoking fee. What we cannot stomach is the performance of this laptop compare to its value. At the Bestbuy store, we were directed to the Geek Squad section to check if our claim is valid (we told the sales person that it is a defective laptop to avoid paying the 15% restocking fee). After seeing the item that I am returning and informing him of the problem, the Geek Squad guy didn't bother to check/open the item. He pointed me directly to the cashier to get my replacement. At that point, we decided to get the MacBook Pro which only cost $1199. We didn't mind if we added a bit more as long as my wife and I are both happy with what we purchased.

Bottom Line:Worked as advertised for 9 months.Incompetent, disorganized customer service.My recommendation:Too many other options to waste your time on a company that doesn't provide product service life or intelligent, capable customer service.The product arrived as advertised and worked flawlessly for approximately 9 months. While deployed in Afghanistan, the battery stopped charging and eventually depleted entirely rendering it inoperative without being plugged in. I contacted customer service via email and was told I'd have to wait until I returned from my deployment due to shipping restrictions to Afghanistan.Once I returned, I immediately called customer service. They, of course, had no record of me. The first 2 calls ended with "Sir, our system is down so call back in an hour or two." On my third attempt I was told I'd receive an email with instructions and an envelope for my battery. Nothing ever arrived.My fourth attempt to contact customer service was infuriating. Once again, my telephone number, serial number, and email address were insufficient to retrieve any record of contact. My warranty has expired during the time of ASUS' inaction and, with no record of my multiple attempts, ASUS essentially told me "sucks to be you."The call center is in the Caribbean and it took 90 - I say again - 90 minutes to get a supervisor. His responses:-That's handled at a different department so I can't look those records up.-I can't fix your problem or place you in contact with someone who can.-Go ahead and email this address and tell them your problem.I informed the manager that if the conversation ended with anything other than "I'm connecting you with someone who can resolve your problem" or "A new battery is on its way" I'd fire them as my laptop provider. His response?-Okay, there's nothing I can do for you.

I bought this machine in April of '10.  In July '10 it stopped working.  I spent 4 weeks calling Asus, getting bad advice (example - Rep #1 "Just flash your bios, that will solve everything"  Rep #2 "Whatever you do, DO NOT flash your bios, it voids the warranty") and taking it to Best Buy (their warranty repair shop) only to have Best Buy tell me they couldn't fix it and did not do warranty work for Asus.  On my last phone call with Asus I heard "Ma'am, it's just not possible for a computer to not have a disc drive. Keep looking" even though this model CLEARLY does not have one.  I finally had to send the laptop back to them (2 weeks and counting) and buy another more reliable laptop elsewhere.It is super light and when working, super fast.  But if you really need it, buy something else.

I hate this product because there is no dvd player with this model. Also, there is no backlight of its keyboard

It has the lowest quality touchpad in the whole universe! Keeps disabling itself and it's going on one's nerves. I will brake it into the smallest pieces as soon as I can afford a Mac. I really don't understand, that they fill it with good stuff, it's fast and it looks nice and then they put this touchpad on it! How difficult is nowadays to find a good touchpad, when everything already touch based. It just shows what this company is like. Buy my stuff and if you hate it's your problem.Ps: the fist one of the same type didn't even boot in. We had to get a replacement one.

I bought it thinking that Sony was a good brand, but they clearly have no clue when it comes to making computers.The first problem is the battery life.  At first, it could last 20 minutes of websurfing, but now it doesn't last five minutes of sitting still with nothing going on.  It immediately powers down without shutting down of hibernating.The second problem is the default hard drive configuration.  Basically, they split it up which causes more problems since so many programs install to the C: drive by default anyway, plus Windows XP is bloated and takes up the majority of the space anyway, then PC-Cillin tries to take up a lot of space too and you've almost lost all of your C: drive space from these two programs alone.The third problem is the graphics card.  It's integrated with the normal memory and has horrible performance.  While I don't expect to be playing the latest games on this machine, it's not even capable of playing games that are ten years old with a decent speed.The fourth problem that I have is the LCD itself.  It's not very bright, and with any sunlight at all it's unreadable.Other than those, it's a pretty standard machine.  I managed to avoid some of the software problems others have by uninstalling one of the hotfixes of XP and upgrading the mouse drivers.

If your are looking for a good used laptop..........look elsehwere.  The FXA47 is loaded with software and problems and VERY POOR customer support.  In the 2 years we have had it, it has stayed in the case most of the time because of lockups.  I have restored it several times to original configurations with no help.  Sony is clueless and wants to charge for phone supoport and has only responded to 1 of my e-mails.  It seems that everytime we install software the computer wants to lock up.  My Compaq 2715US works great with out any problems.  I will never by another Sony product.

Updated November 2012.I cannot recommend the G75VW-DS73-3D which is a pity as it's a nice looking machine when its working. In fairness to Asus after months of haggling they sent me a replacement G75 at their expense. But it has the exact same hangs freezes and system lockups! Is this coincidence? A bad batch perhaps? I don't know, so I'll leave it to the prospective buyer to decide.... Nvidia Driver updates do not fix the problem believe me I've tried, and Asus VIP support is the absolute worst!If you want to know what problems you might face with this laptop read this letter below to Asus that I sent after test driving a second G75 for a month. Incidentally, a common fault is that both G75's also had wrongly configured Atheros Ethernet slow upload speeds, making me think additional patch(s) weren't run at the time of the build. Either that or its an outright bad batch of G75's with bad 670m GPU's. Either way Asus have no solution. I will probably sell mine 2nd hand and buy a Samsung because I looked at the Samsung Series 7 and regret not buying it, as the Nvidia 675 appears more stable.If anyone has any questions about the G75 I can answer them in the comments section. For instance is the 3D worth it? In my view: NO! Playing for hours will almost certainly give you headaches as the 3D is not as comfortable as watching a 3D movie at the cinema. Basically the active shutter glasses approach causes strain on the eyes. Moreover the 3D means every game is darker, and even with brightness turned up within the game and in the power options, the clarity is not as good.Dear Asus,You misunderstand the problem. Please read carefully! I'm certain thesystem freezes are solely due to the buggy 670m GPU. How do I knowthis? Because the system can occasionally recover from a pendingcrash. When it can, it logs this message :-"Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered."Most other times it fails to recover, and the system hangs which thenrequires a hard reboot. Either way the symptoms are always the same!But I'm sure you know this already from internal testing?! Or are yousaying that both of my G75's are part of a rare bad batch? I have afeeling that the Samsung Series 7 with the 675 is more stable andthat's why there are less complaints about it.To directly address your question though. I choose to rebuild the newG75 from scratch. The system image / Windows Easy Transfer optionsweren't that useful anyway. But so far on the new G75, I've onlyinstalled the basic programs. So I've held off installing lots ofgames and the game design software that I use, such as Unity 3D, UDKand Blender etc.Also note, the crashes mostly happen on the Desktop when merely usingExplorer, or Firefox with plug-ins / JavaScript disabled. Or runningIE with basic plug-ins enabled or just using MS Office. Please note thatfollowing on from Asus-ROG postings on G75 hangs, the new G75 has disabled :-A. all anti-virus software (uninstalled),B. all unneeded Services...C. all Scheduled Tasks...D. all registry RUN commands & updaters etc.

got it turned it on, blue screen of death, had to run the maintenance utility to format it back to factory settings,once functioning it would constantly freeze, i would get the blue screens, sometimes it would stay stuck in a rebooting loop, nvidia video card driver would crash constantly, not a great experience for an asus product

**update**i have sent the laptop for repair atleast 4 times now. now they finally claimed (after a year and a half) that the laptop is not repair-able and they would exchange it. think twice before buying anything from asus!!!. (even though they pay for shipping through fed-ex, they wouldnt provide the box and fed-ex will always charge for a box $25 x4 because they wouldn't let me re-use the box. either way i have moved to alienware laptop now and currently selling this laptopi have own this laptop for over a year now (its still under warranty). i got this as a desktop replacement.anyways what is horrible about this laptop is that it is shutting down every single day. i would say it will shutdown randomly at least once a day (even while surfing internet)i have contacted customer service many times, they normally ask your laptop back and claim "they fixed it" (which is basically re-installing windows). after the laptop is sent back to me.. it will run fine for about 2 months and then same problems starts over. as for now, i am re-sending this laptop for the last final time because my warranty period will expire around this novemeber..i would say they are pretty smart on how to deal with warranty. anyways i wouldnt buy a laptop from them ever again.. if you are looking for something nice.. try msi laptop..

In all fairness this was not bought on amazon but the exact laptop was bought at walmart.com. We even got the 2yr drop break spill warranty from them. The laptop was wonderful for the first few weeks. When we tried to use the webcam we noticed it was very dark. In about another week the laptop began to get very slow, next it would jamb up and you would have to restart it. Finally in another week the blue screen of death appeared with error message. We were told we had to contact TOSHIBA as it was still under warranty. (Just over a month had we had it by now) Toshiba tried to do some stuff over the phone and then the tech said that it was a bad hard drive, that it happened alot if there was a bvad batch and it would have to be replaced. He said he would e-mail me the info. Well it turns out that it is going to cost us 25.00 to mail this computer back to them. You know I would not complain if the laptop was out of warrenty or older but we hadn't had it for just over a month. No idea if it will work when it comes back or for how long.

If all you were ever going to do on a computer was type reports for say, school projects, than by all means by this computer. But for ther rest of the world, with Netlix accounts, or avid gamers. This is a sore disappointment. it can't even run simple movies off of the DVD drive without being overloaded and crashing.

I don't like it bacause it too slow d curser movement I dnt lke it I rather a windows 7

buying this laptop felt like a scam . it said open box  ( new ) i really taught it  was just the box open .  this laptop was used . the sad part for me in live in trinidad and it would of cost me a fortune to send it back . the seller gave me back 20 dollars lol .

This PC is satisfying my needs in every way. It is not a superspeed, metal case computer; but then again that's not what I wanted or was willing to pay for. It is not the fastest computer, but I need it mostly for email and internet browsing for which it does a good job. My only concern is "will it be reliable?". With this price point, I do hope they still built in HP reliability.PRO...........one of the last 15.6 PC's out there without a numberic keypad. For me that is a huge plus.CON...........if you want to get to the hard drive you basically have to take the computer apart to get at it. I am used to removing two srcews and sliding them out. I have also determined that this computer will support windows 8 only. You cannot load windows 7. Major flaw and reason to return this extremely limited computer.

I have had this computer for going on 2 years and it is a complete piece of crap.  It has been nothing but trouble from day one.  It loses connection constantly and you have to shut the browser down and pull it all back up.  Or it will just sit there and do nothing. There are connection lost screens that pop up constantly for no reason. If I use it while someone else is using anything that requires internet it will kick them off or not allow them on the internet at all.  I can run 3 xboxes all on xbox live at the same time but if I turn this thing on it shuts everyone down.  I have searched numerous sites on trouble shooting and nothing has worked.  I hate this laptop and couldn't even with good conscience sell it to someone. It is a cheap laptop and it shows.

As I sit here writing this review, I am using the THIRD Toshiba laptop I have had to go back to get..the first one was this model, and the Wi-Fi just quit. Just stopped. nothing would make it start up again.It would only connect to the internet with a cabled connection. For a 400$ laptop, that is just unacceptable. Luckily, I had bought it at Office Depot, and they exchanged it without a problem ( it was 12 days old). I brought the second one home, and used it, loaded all the "stuff" I needed on it (not a small job) and it worked fine...for about 2.5 weeks.On start up, about 3 times out of 5, it would refuse to load web pages.The toolbar showed it was hooked into the network, and no troubleshooting program showed a problem. I restarted the unit, and it then worked. This started to happen a lot, so I tried hooking in a network cable, and sure enough, it worked fine...another bad wi-fi unit. I then traded up to the next better Toshiba ( i3 intel, 6 GB), hopefully it has a better wi-fi unit, and/or a better management program for it.I guess we'll see.I am very disappointed, Toshiba!

I must say that I have been a loyal Toshiba customer for 8 years. I have purchased three computers from them as well as various accessories. I must say that I was thrilled by my previous two laptops, one is too old to mention, and the other I passed down to my mother. No problems, peppy little things and no complaints. That is, until I recently purchased the Satellite C855D-S5351. The internet barely works, and by barely works I mean oftentimes it doesn't want to connect to the network despite full service; this is especially true after waking it from hibernation. I also detest the mouse pad because it is set up to function like a tablet, I suppose. I barely move my finger and it flicks from my desktop to the horrible Windows 8 tile screen (whatever it is called, it is terrible and impractical for a laptop.) And even worse, sometimes I have to hard boot the computer because it simply refuses to shut down. Games lag, and not heavy multi-player games like World of Warcraft either, but girlie games like The Sims.Even worse is the fact that Microsoft decided not to include a word processor. I mean, really? I have to have a word processor, there is no way around it and I did not appreciate being forced to fork over another $100+ for the privilege of writing papers and conducting my business. Terrible move, Microsoft.But the worst part by far is the screen. It has cracked twice, making it virtually unusable. And I do not abuse my laptop, I have never dropped it, nor do I stomp on it or hit it. My 10 lb dog decided to walk across it and it crackled like ice. I have never had this problem in the past, and at one point I was rather rough on my computer, taking it back and forth to college, it would sometimes get squished against books and the like, and I have never, ever had this problem!Forever the optimist, I assume that it is a flaw in this particular design and I will eventually purchase a new one (you know, when I can save up for the overpriced product) and hope that Toshiba wows me, otherwise, I am going to find another brand, another product, something that will hold up to normal use and the plight of tiny animals.

I retract my previous review. This low-end Toshiba is, well, low-end. I've owned it for about three months and my keyboard is already worn out. The a and s keys consistently fail to register and require major force to work at all. I don't even use it regularly.The speakers are garbage, sounds like something from the 80's. Only the most minimal audio is achievable with them and sounds are often indiscernible because of overload.The other day my laptop fell off the side of my bed, which is like two feet high. Now all sound doesn't work. Nothing. No sound at all. Its pathetic. If I watch a youtube video on loud volume, it will sputter and make screeching noises intermittently. I've had an entire computer table collapse on an old E-Machine before and nothing was wrong with it. I've banged and banged on a Compaq laptop before because its harddrive was worn out and it still performed all of its basic operations afterwards.

Speakers: garbageKeyboard: garbageProcessor: mediocreAfter a few months, the computer now really bogs down when starting up. I guess you pay for what you get.It slid off my bed awhile back and now the sound doesn't work at all, either speakers or headphones.

Windows 8 is bad enough, but the keyboard and touchpad on this computer are horrible as well. This is basically what I would expect from a a computer for half this price.

I received the Macbook today and I was so excited to use the macbook. But the power button doesn't turn on w/o connected to outlet eventhough the battery charge indicator  shows enough power.

When I received it, it was perfectly fine than all of a sudden the battery crashes and then I needed to pay a fortune to get a new one

I bought this laptop Late 2008, with standard 1 year warranty given all the positive reviews it had received. It was great while it worked. However it seems that just after its anniversary the wireless wouldn't work with my router, which connects to about 5 other PCs without issues. Then the airport card finally gave up and now I get a message saying Airport not installed.I now have a laptop without wireless. I am trying to fix it myself, i really cant afford to send it to apple... funny that I can not find parts anywhere. anybody any suggestions on where I could get an airport card for this?... except ebay. Now that is something to consider. For PC's you can get the hardware anywhere..After doing some research online.. I found that there were some quality issues with airport in the past too... when brand new laptops wouldn't have airport/bluetooth because someone FORGOT to connect the pins?So yeah my advice would be to buy a good warranty on this.

I bought a MacBook Pro directly from the Apple store.  At first I was impressed by the speed, mostly booting up and shutting down, considering I was used to a PC with Windows Vista.  Over time, things started locking up just like on a PC.  7 months old and the battery is about to die.  A friend of mine has a $2600 MacBook Pro that already needed the DVD drive replaced.  I sold this thing and got a $300 PC laptop that runs just as well and just as quickly with Windows 7.  Lesson learned: sometimes, more expensive is not better.

Overall the design is nice and clean - but resting your hands on the front edge as you use the mousepad hurts due to the very sharp edge...I have a piece of bubble wrap below my wrists as I am typing this. I have owned 20 or so laptops and have never had one with this terrible flaw.

I got a Mac believing in those Mac vs PC TV ads. I thought that I would be able to find games, use my existing USB devices with the Mac. Many of my devices, including my scanner, my card reader, do not work with Mac. I can't find apps that I had back on Windows. I will return this back to the Apple store and switch back to PC.Apple advertises that Macs have better device support... Sorry but that's just a lie. I was much more happier with Windows... :(

I placed my order on Sep 4th, and since I wanted to split my order into 2 charges with 2 different Credit Cards, I noticed I could not, and therefore I called Amazon's Customer service, and they told me that I could not do it, so I simply said, OK I will go to Apple site, and buy it there, and the customer service rep said, well what you can do is to buy a Gift Certificate with one of your cards, you get an e-mail right away from Amazon with that number, and use that, with your other card, and the problem is solved. It sounded simple, and I did it. I waited 1 hour, and 2 and 3, and then called Amazon again, and they said to wait couple of hours, and I will get it. I waited until 12AM Sep 5th (since I wanted to go out of US, and needed to do this before leaving), and they assured me by the time I am up, I will have that number in my in-box.Next day there was nothing from Amazon, so again I called, and this time I was assured by 5PN that day the number will be there. At 6PM it was there, and I used it and made a 1279 dollars purchase.Amazon tried to put 3 charges, each 1279 through my Bank, therefore they stopped all of them, and I did not know about any since I was out of the country, until Sep10th(which was the date, I was suppose to get the shipment delivered to my house0. Again I had to call Amazon for almost 6 more times, and every time some joker was telling me, that let me know your Bank phone number, and we will take care of it, and for 4 days this went on, and on. I called Amazon again, since daily I was getting e-mails from them saying my order has not gone through, because of insufficient funds in my account. I called, and asked the rep what is going on, and after her trying not to answer my questions, she said let's call your Bank, and talk to them directly(I am not sure if you have tried to call your bank directly these days or not, but it is not an easy task) but we did anyhow, and my bank's rep told the Amazon rep, that the reason the charges were denied, has been the quantities of them, and she said in the past 2 days alone, Amazon has requested 5 times, the amount of 1279 dollars(If you remember I bought it a 500 gift certificate, and the true charge should have been 779 dollars), so I told my bank give a verbal OK with Authorization number to Amazon Rep and let's get this thing resolve once and for ever, and when she tried, Amazon refuse to accept it, and told me that I have to cancel my order and order this again, and when I asked her to let me talk to your manager, and why did you ask to have my bank online, if you knew that later on you will refuse their Authorization, she put me on eternal hold, and then I got cut off.So I tried to cancel my order, but the system would not let me, so I called Amazon again, and asked to talk to a manager, and every time you call you have to tell your whole story otherwise you will not get an opportunity to talk to a manager. When I told him that, he said no Robert, you do not have to do this, and we are putting your order through, and charge you 779(since I did lose 7 days by then I upgraded the shipping, and after 500 dollars gift certificate, my charge out of my bank account raised to 809.00), and he said he will e-mail me about our talk, and this amount, and do not worry about anything Robert, TRUST ME.Believe it or not I never got an e-mail, and on Sunday 13th, Amazon went ahead and charged my account more than 1300 dollars, and since I did not expected them they will do that, and I got assured the total amount after 500 dollars gift certificate will be 809.00, I went ahead, and used my ATM card for other purposes. Amazon by doing that caused my account to be over drafted and I ended up getting 100 dollars bank fee for that reason alone.So what did I do today? Guess. Called Amazon again (this was my 17th times, since Sep 4th). They said that Amazon Gift department somehow missed giving me credit for 500 dollars, and therefore 1309 dollars went through my account instead of 809 dollars, and it will be 10 days until they can resolve this.I wish Jeff Bezo will know these types of horror stories happening to his loyal customers. I have been Amazon's loyal customer, and even though we are not rich, we bought over 3000 dollars of goods in the past 3 months from Amazon. I swear to my mother's life, that no longer will I do business with Amazon, after this past 10 hell days. I have spent over 19 hours on the phone, and have been so upset the other day, I thought I am having a heart attack, and guess what it is still not over, and I have to deal with it another 10 days. Just for one deal. Then people say what is wrong with corporate America? This is it, lack of care, and do not giving a DAM what your customer feels, and goes through. If I would have decided the other day to go through Apple (even though their laptop price was 10 dollars less), and was not a loyal customer of Amazon, I would have been using my laptop 1 week, and already was used to it, and on top of that I would have not spent 1 hour with some Joe Shmo on Philippines, day in, and day out.SAHAME ON AMAZON to take of customers like me and my wife this way, SHAME.Robert Shah

I love the MacBook but not Amazon order fullfilment!I placed my order (Product IN STOCK) with the "Saturday Delivery" option, but amazon CANNOT ship nor deliver the order as promised. They emailed me a sorry notice and "gladly" refunded the shipping charge. Big deal! You can't cancel nor change order at this time. And the web site continue to advertise next day or 2-day delivery when they know that they cannot do so. FALSE ADVERTISING. I called and nobody knew when or where the order was!!

I have owned this computer (the exact one for sale) for about six months now and I use it everyday for class.  IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A WORSE COMPUTER.  It is the least responsive computer I have ever owned.  It is true that it rarely freezes but it is forever h...hes...hesi...hesitating.  The touch-pad decides when it does and doesn't want to work, which as you can imagine, is extremely frustrating.  Sometimes it will just decide that it wants to turn off, and it does, without warning.  Finally, it cannot understand how to find and maintain an internet connection.  I have an old powerbook (mac) that can find and connect to wireless twice as fast as this brand new laptop, that comes pretty highly rated.  I run Vista business (required at my law school) so maybe that is part of it, but it certainly can't be all of it.  Just thought I should put in my 2 cents since all these ratings are so high, figured I would let people know there is certainly another side.

Buy one used. The computer had signs of heavy usage. I was surprice that the computer turn ON. Lockdown once, and had to install the OP System Again. Since them is working. Performance is low since no have enough RAM and an faster HD. I do not recommend to run demanding Applications. It is heavy to carry over 6 pounds.

My workplace has 31 of those laptop, as a IT tech there wasn't a single day, I  faced any problem with those laptop.

Overall it's a good buy if you are in a budget.I would have given more stars but the computer feels cheap and they saved money where they shouldn't. For example, they should have chosen a 7200RPM hard drive instead, the difference in cost is about $10 and the performance would be far greater.The battery is also a minus... I was expecting as technology progresses, a better battery. The camera behaves as the worst camera in the market, very low quality and provides low resolution images. Also it does not work well under low light conditions.I'm aware that this laptop is not a premium one but a few more details would have made this product a home run and not just another one on the market.***Review Update**** 01/29/13Now the laptop's WiFi stops working randomly. Unfortunately, Amazon can't help much and the only way of getting it fixed is sending my brand new laptop over mail to Acer's service center in Texas. I will have to pay for the shipping on top of staying without a computer for who knows how much time. Also if they give me another laptop, I will have to migrate all of my data and re-install all of my software. That's going to cost me more than the laptop itself. I should have spent a little more on a Lenovo. I regret so much buying this laptop.

I decided to go against my norm and bought a lenovo. I have previously owned two toshiba laptops and they have performed well over their life spans of three and two years respectively. However, this purchase has left me wondering why i decided to switch brands. The battery will not charge in the laptop at all. Both charger and battery have been placed in a similar unit and no problem, however no luck with it working in mine. The laptop will only run with the charger plugged in or if i charge the battery in another laptop. Numerous calls and e-mails to lenovo will not help. Please stay away, their customer service is almost non-existent. Save yourself the trouble and look for a laptop somewhere else.

Lenovo's reputation for quality comes from its' association with IBM products. That's the reason I bought this laptop. What surprised me was that the keyboard frequently skips letters when typing at speed, many different ones. I type anywhere between 70 and 100 wpm and this going back and correcting everything over and over was very time consuming and surprising. The other thing that surprised me was the touchpad; every time that the heel of my hands touched the thing the cursor would go flying off across the view screen or it would bizarrely highlight various parts of the text or the screen. I don't believe this is a defect but a built in flaw in the design. Both of these problems have never happened with Toshiba, Dell, HP, Compaq, ASUS or other computers I've used in the past.Another very annoying aspect of the touchpad was that the Windows 8.0 side bar would show up without any prompting and stop the cursor until a double tap on the touchpad freed it up stalling the typing process. This too was lousy.The screen for viewing was average, not great and the sound seemed somewhat harsh compared to other laptops I've used.We deleted all the personal data, boxed it up and sent it back to Amazon.com for a refund. I've replaced it with a Dell laptop which is functioning perfectly in all the areas where the Lenovo has failed. In addition, my experience with their customer service over the phone was surprising and excellent. Lenovo's wasn't when I contacted them.Amazon also was helpful, polite and responsive quickly.

I will never buy a Toshiba again! I bought a Toshiba touch screen laptop and within a week the screen started to crack. I called Toshiba customer service cause you have a 1 year warranty. I called and they said we wont cover any damages to screens. I told them touch screen is a feature and they should back there product. They did not care. I have to wait a year till my in store warranty can kick in.

Toshiba low-end laptops are pure garbage. Flimsy, cheap, unreliable, and built with the cheapest components available. Save your money and spend a bit more on something else not built by Toshiba. Best case scenario, you might get 6-12 months out of your laptop before things start to fail. Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba. Consider any laptops made by Toshiba as being purely disposable, or built for third word countries with no consumer protection laws.

We received at least one machine that seems refurbished rather than new and it was also DOA (keyboard didn't work).

A very low quality laptop. I've had so many problems with this computer I can't even begin to discuss them all. The main issue right now is that the touch screen doesn't respond to touch anymore, which makes Windows 8 the biggest nightmare in the world to navigate. The sound controls sometimes work, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the touch pad works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the size of the screen expands to 200% and won't go back until I restart the computer. I've had to wipe clean the computer twice to get it to function correctly, as correct as possible without a touch screen that is. Screws unscrew themselves on the bottom of the laptop and fall out occasionally. Please save yourself a headache and spend an extra $100-200 dollars on a better quality, non-Toshiba product. I wish i had.

DO NOT Order from Ocean Reef Electronics....this has got to be one of the worst companies when it come to customer service or lack there of....I bought this tablet through Amazon shipped to me from this company, the first day I got it and plugged it up straight out of the box the computer said plugged in battery not charging...I left plugged overnight and when I got up the next morning the battery had 0% charge on it???I ht e followed a few steps that I googled to try to get it to charge didn't work... First contacted the company got an answering machine and told to go to Amazon to send a message, did that... Waited the following day called company again during regular business hours again got a message to go to Amazon...I left a message this time and went back to Amazon...they finally sent me a email instructing me on how to return the item, but the thing is they make you pay for sending it back to them when it's their fault you got a faulty item anyway...and on top of that they don't try to resolve the issue with replacement (because I really need a computer) they just say send it back and Amazon will refund you once they receive it...Wow! In my opinion the email seemed so rude and disconcerning of me as a customer...so I'm sending back will go to best buy to buy a laptop in person...WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN...MAKE YOU OWN DECISON...GOOD LUCK,!!!

This is the worst computer I have ever used. It's slow, it lags, it has crashed several times and I hardly have any documents or anything on it. Windows 8 is confusing and hard to navigate. Not to mention how difficult it is to find things on this pc. One of my biggest issues was buying office online. Every time I try to run the installation, it says it ran into an error and couldn't install. And I don't know why, but for some reason the internet is so painfully slow compared to other computers. Also the amount of popups I get while on any browser (even Firefox) is absurd. And yes I do have antivirus software, but it seems it hasn't done much. I've even had it "cleaned up", but still runs horribly slow. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone, especially a college student. Once I have the money, I'm switching over to a Macbook.

Let me start off by saying that I had high hopes for this little machine. I understood from the beginning that the computer's specs reflect the cost, so I expected there to be some quirks. This is my first Windows 8 machine, so there was a slight learning curve but I had it down in under a day. Aside from the awkward setup that Windows 8 is based on, this machine is SLOW, WEAK and DIES quickly. This Acer Aspire One wishes it could hang, but it just cant. Even simple tasks can make this computer freeze up, resulting in lost time. When this computer gets overwhelmed and has a fit, you are not getting anything else done for at least 10-20 minutes. Depending on the amount of work you were attempting to accomplish, the machine might even restart itself on it's lovely 12 minute restart cycle. I mean that too! This thing just sits and sits, never giving a consistent restart time. Even with the machine working flawlessly, my internet will just drop out and that's it. Sometimes it will automatically reconnect itself, but mostly I end up having to restart the machine. A return wasn't an option, so I headed down to the nearest Wal-Mart that carried this model on display. I brought my cord with me and managed to find a plug and fired the display unit up. Someone had already set it up, so I was good to play around and see if my computers experience was anything realistic. Sure enough, not even a few minutes into me testing my personal scenarios the machine locked up. This time, not even long presses of the power button could get it to restart. I couldn't take the battery out of the display unit, so I abandoned my mission feeling like this Acer Aspire One is really just a POS that I happened to buy. For the money, it's just not worth it. I had a smaller, Atom powered, Windows 7 netbook that out performed this Windows 8 machine all day long. I just needed something more and thought the Acer would have provided that. People, don't end up like me with an Expensive Paperweight that will sit on craiglist until the end of days... Stay away, trust me.

I wish I could have rated this zero stars but on Amazon you can only rate 1.The trackpad sucks so badly that I never use it and always carry an external mouse.The screen sucks too because it's reflective so unless you have perfect lighting it's hard to see.There is this stupid program it runs called read HD audio or some s*** that takes up CPU and if you stop it the headphone jack won't work.  So either you have a slow computer or no headphones.  On, yeah it's already very slow anyways.The worst part is the pathetic battery life.  I always leave this piece of s*** plugged in.  I also have the screen set to dim and the battery life still sucks.  like 2 hours or something pathetic.So, in conclusion, the screen is bad, the mouse is bad, the battery is bad, and it's slow.  Worst laptop you can get.I regret buying this piece of s*** and will never get an Acer again.(lol first world problems)

this is one of the worst laptops you can get in this price range. Just keep looking and you will find a better one

Not cool MSI NOT COOL!!!! I was so excited to get a new gaming computer and overnighted this computer for a World of Warcraft raid. I needed a new gaming computer because of lagging on my old computer, which I am using as we speak(AND THE MOUSE TOUCHPAD WORKS ON THE OLD COMPUTER!!!) OMG I could not do the raid or even download the game, because the mouse touchpad and keyboard did not work out of the box!! Since the mouse touchpad and keyboard did not work, I could not surf the web to download the game or add my new virus protection. The keyboard kept locking up, so much that it was impossible to even tab to register my information on the computer. The technical support for MSI USA was NO support at all,and just tried to blame it on packaging or a hardware issue. There was no damage to the laptop package when I got it, and Amazon.com did a good job with delivery of the computer. I am very disappointed that a $1400.00 dollar computer came with such defects!!! >:< I will never again buy any computers from this company again!!! I had to return the computer and get my money back.

Okay folks, after researching which gaming computers are good to buy on a budget, I choose this one. The computer came in a nice box that had no damage at all. After the first use of the computer, I had a issue with the sound. I noticed the sound was jacked up while playing my World of Warcraft game. I needed to use Ventrillo, in order to discuss some game mechanics to my fellow players during a raid. WOW, each time I listen to them speak to me, I heard this awful static sound. It was like I was turning the nob on a ancient radio looking for a channel to listen to. I complained to the guys in my raid that I was having a hard time listening to them, and quickly finished my raid. So, the next day I called technical support about the sound problem on the computer. Boy did I get no where after two hours of reformatting the computer and downloading and uploading the Realtek software driver, which controls the sound. I still heard the static noise even when following the tech guys instructions. One technical support guy at MSI USA just had no clue and just told me it was a hardware issue and instructed me to return it to Amazon.com. On the other hand, another technical support guy told me to keep trying to download the Realtek driver software to fix the static noise. I was getting really annoyed with the technical support because of the impatient attitude of one of the tech guys, while helping me fix the problem. After getting no where with technical support, I actually did what one of then told me not to do. I actually delete the RealTek driver from the computer and WHAM BAM THANK YOU MA'AM, the sound issue was fixed. The Microsoft sound software kicked in and the sound was perfect. I can't believe that I was sent a brand new computer, which was not that cheap 1400.00 bucks!, and the sound was screwed up out of the box. That was really bad, I don't think I will deal with this company again. Take my advice and stay away.

The products are quality with some great thought into the design & parts. I would say overall the performance is 4 outta 5 stars.MSI does not offer replacement keyboards on their "Steelseries" version laptops nor does Steelseries. You have to send it in for "service" which has a 2 week turnaround. I will not pay to have someone else to do such a simple task that I have done hundreds of times. Replacing a keyboard is simple. Nor will I send in my laptop for 2 weeks. That's ridiculous.There are no aftermarket replacement keyboards either. Do not buy. I have officially boycotted all MSI products because of this. I have burned 5+hours with support from both MSI and Steelseries on this problem.Buy from a manufacturer who offers replacement parts. Hardware goes bad, you want to be able to replace it.This is why they get 1 star.

I bought this laptop at compusa.com, on the second day of installing updates and company of heroes of course the game ran flawlessly with highest settings, for movies I downloaded the vlc player to watch my movie collection on external hard drive which also ran smoothly, I'm not a music lover so I don't have any info on the subject. Well, on the third day when I pushed the internet explorer icon instead of going to my yahoo page I got the blue screen of death (bummer) I'm not a computer tech but I know enough to diagnose the problem somewhat. To make a long story short, I called Asus to fix the problem but as usual my dog probably has more knowledge than these clowns at Asus, anyway the problem I think was the internal hardrive because it never got passed the windows 7 logo. Thankfully I returned it to compusa.com in which it was a nightmare to get my money back but finally did on the third week of talking to these clowns at compusa.com. Now I'm thinking of purchasing this laptop through either amazon or xoticpc, but i have shivers of doing so.I'm hoping I was just the unlucky one to get a bad labtop, because most than few of reviews I've read or heard is nothing but good machine.[[ASIN:B0044UF0L6 ASUS G53JW-A1 Republic of Gamers 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (Black)

My last Sony VAIO completely died and I made the mistake of giving Sony a 2nd shot. Let's just say in the span of the one-year limited warranty that I had my laptop serviced about 6 or 7 times. I literally lost count. The fan was replaced 3 times. The display was replaced once. And now? The display is all about flickering and rainbows. $500 to replace. I said no. I could buy a new computer for that.No more Sony laptops for me.

No more Sony anything for me.My pink laptop started making loud noises and CPU utlization goes up to 40% and stays there for having one browser window with no plug-ins opened.Closing the lid does not put the computer to sleep as set.  Sony Backup thing keeps popping up when computer is turned on and no way to make it go away, even after clicking "don't show again".Media control button stopped working.Function buttons that adjusts the brightness, sound, screen position stopped working.Screen started flickering.I've only had this computer for 3 months. Love the pinkness and hate everything else.Spent hours talking to tech support on Dec 23 online and on the phone.  Was told to take computer into local service desk.  Found one at Beverly Center and spent Christmas Eve there. Technician told me I have to have the receipt with me (would be nice for them to tell me when I called to make the appointment). And that they have to ship in the computer and it would take at least 2 weeks for me to get it back because the Service Desk can't do anything at the store except help customers ship in the computer.Spent another 45 min on the phone with Service Center on the phone to schedule someone to come out instead.Was told technician would come out and fix it in 3 business days.  3 business days have come and gone... no calls.. so called in today to find out what's up.  Been on the phone for 2 hours now just to try to get the time the technician would come out.Asked them what part was shipped out to fix these problems and was told "the fan".  AMAZING FAN!!! A simple fan can fix all these issues!!!!Turns out that Sony outsource the service to a company called Nexicore and after 2 hours, Sony just told me here's the number to Nexicore... try calling them. Sweet deal. Back to Dell from now on.

Just so everyone is aware, this computer has no cd/dvd drive!! I got this laptop for a good price, but it is completely worthless without a cd drive. I'm not dishing out the extra $ for an external one, what's the point?

Had to return. Did not perform as expected.  Return process was very OK.  It was too slow, blue ray did not work.

Unfortunately, all of the wonderful aspects of the laptop do not make up for the problems. The screen is gorgeous, the colors are lovely, the price is right for an array of excellent features. I dearly love my little guy, but he is no longer reliable (this matters to me because I use it for work and running statistical models). There is an electrical problem which forces the computer to randomly shut down (other customers have been told it is related to over heating). After looking up multiple potential ways to fix, I became aware the there are a LOT of people with HP laptops (a multitude of different HP laptops) that all have the same set of problems, including faulty/easy to break powercords.  That is all well and good, expected as no computer is perfect. I also have a macbook and have had problems with it over the years, but Apple has had, by and large, amazing customer support. HP on the other hand is the most awful, deviant company I have ever spoken to. After your 1 year warranty is up, they refuse to even talk to you. Unless you pay them an inordinate sum of money. Companies that do not stand by their products and repeatedly issue products with similar problems are dishonest and I will no longer be an HP customer after this. HP, you have let us down.

Bought this computer in December and after 5 weeks died. Contact HP and they tried to repair it but couldn't over the phone. So I shipped it too them and when it was returned it crashed that day. HP has the worst customer service and are terrible to deal with. Was promised a replacement & after waiting two weeks, no computer and was told they didn't have any more. Then they promised to build one and I waited 2 more weeks and still no computer. So the good folks at Amazon are taking it back and giving me a full refund. So warning to all laptop buyers beware HP is the a black hole for replacement. Thank goodness for Amazon.

When I first got this laptop I wanted something for school work, my pictures and videos (I don't keep them on the laptop, just edit on it), and for browsing the web. With 4gb of Ram and a 500gb hard drive I assumed this would more than do the job. Within the first couple of weeks that I had it, I had to send it out to HP and have the keyboard replaced because my keys were getting stuck and falling off. Not long after I started noticing my battery life was terrible, an hour at most, that honestly didn't bother me as it's too large to really travel with anyways. However, currently I am once again missing keys, my laptop battery no longer charges and even though it is at 45% it cannot stay on without the A/C adapter attached. I don't want to own another HP just because this laptop was such a terrible investment. Now, I don't have a laptop for school and I can't afford to replace this one (not even for something smaller). Overall, I'm very disappointed in this laptop and I would not recommend it to anyone, student or otherwise.

We bought this for our home computer in 2010 since then the computer has completely crashed, needed a new hard drive and has a defective keyboard. It has a nice, large screen with great resolution but this is one of the worst laptops I've had. We are now having problems with the cursor skipping around at random times - I cannot tell you how many emails I've accidentally sent due to a misplaced cursor. I've owned several other HP's and did not have these problems. This computer is only 2 years old and I cannot wait to get rid of it.

I purchased this laptop rather hastily when my Sony Vaio laptops hard drive died after 6 years of service. Right out of the box this computers performance was mediocre at best mainly due to the vast array of HP programs (gimmicks)that come pre-installed. After about three months of ownership this HP product really started showing its evil and ugly face. It all started with what appeared to be a problem with the video/graphics card and/or its drivers. If you try to play streaming videos from the web with the sound on it will simply crash....every time! After several calls to HP and dozens of attempts to troubleshoot and fix the problems using the HP support programs, I have come to the conclusion that this laptop is really just that bad. Another problem that I have encountered that absolutely blows my mind is its inability to connect to other HP brand products. My wifes father gave her a really nice HP printer for Christmas and it takes 30 minutes to connect to the printer every time you want to print something. This is a prime example of how poor HP products really are, my Cannon printer works every time. After months of being angry at this laptop my wife took it for herself and made me buy a new Dell brand laptop. I am counting the days that it takes for her to finally loose her mind and throw it in the garbage. In a nutshell, this product may be just fine if you use it for simple web browsing and simple programs only. Be prepared for extremely slow product updates, extremely poor tech support, and an endless amount of crashes, reboots, and lost data. I know this review may seem a little harsh but if a zero star rating were an option I would have picked it. Learn from my mistake and save your hard earned money to buy a Dell or Sony.

This laptop lasted 3 weeks then crapped out.  Spent several hours on phone w/ tech support before it was officially pronounced dead, now HP will NOT take it back for a refund. GRRRRR!!!  Aside from being a cheap piece of junk, it's designed very poorly - the mouse pad is the same textured plastic as the casing and will drive you crazy, the keyboard is spread out, yet there's no separation between the keys, which means big, clumsy keys that you have the spread your fingers over to use.I had a similar problem with an HP printer 3 years ago, should have learned!.  I'll never buy an HP product again!

update:The plug where the a/c adapter plugs into the laptop is loose.  It falls out on it's  own several times a day.  I have to roll it around at different angles and use weights to hold it against the connector so it stays in contact.  It's gradually getting worse & worse.  If I go take a bath & I'm in the middle of something, when I come back the laptop will be powered down because the plug popped out in the middle of the bath.  Now there's a short in the connection too so, often the whole a/c adaptor getts shorted out & turns itself off.  I have to fiddle around for sometimes 5 minutes to find just the right twist & angle & OOps, the adaptor got shorted, now I have to unplug it from the wall & plug it back in & keep trying to find a spot where it will stay plugged in & powered on & then I have to put a weight on the plug to hold it in just the right angle... & then I have to keep the laptop from sliding in the other direction and on top of that:The headphone jack is bad too.  I have to hang a weight on my headphone cable so that it put's pulling pressure on the jack just to be able to hear anything, which might not be so bad if the speakers didn't entirely break down.  I cannot hear a single thing through the speakers.  Nothing at all.  The speakers were always too quiet, but now, they just gave up & quit working.Another thing, NO RADIOSHACK sells the plug that fits this laptop.  I've tried.  I bought a plug  that came close, but it doesn't fit right.  The radio shacks even refuse to order the correct size.  So, is this normal for this laptop?  Who cares.  I'm never getting an acer again & I'll never buy a laptop with a cheap, skinny a/c adaptor connection port either.The built in microphone is worthless too.  It filters the sound badly.I have to put black tape over the camera so that my keys type the correct words on the keyboard.  Typical TI BS.Bad speakers, shakey touchpad, cheap keys, no support for linux, great screen, lots of ram.The speakers are terrible.  They are so small and cheap that mine just blew out while playing a sound near 120 hz.Instead of getting better speakers, they killed the volume, so you wouldn't damage the cheap speakers it came with.Now the sound system is supposed to be able to play 24-bit sound, BUT somewhere along the line, it gets heavily corrupted.  It doesn't play true 24-bit sound.  It may be the link between the soundchip & the speakers.  I don't know, but I am certain that the sound-quality is far less than what the sound-chip is capable of, due to cheap & crummy hardware, not just the speakers.  If you plug headphones in, you still get distorted hi-def sound at 24-bit.Finally, it's very difficult to listen to anything with the speakers, even before they were blown.  If I put the system on max volume & the youtube video, or whatever on max volume, you'd be lucky to make out the words.  It's that bad.Tip to others w/ this laptop:  download soundfiles as an MP3 and play it in winamp or something and adjust the  graphic equalizer so all the freqs are all maxed & if that doesn't work, you can open the sound-file in audacity & amplify the soundfile 10 decibles (you'll have to clip some) & you might be able to make out the words.  Or upload it to an mp3 player.I've had  3 keys come off.  I can't put them back on.  My laptops take  a beating.Every now & then the touchpad goes nuts.  I'll push the mouse-cursor up and it will go down.  I'll push it across the screen & it just stays in 1 place & shakes a little.  Sometimes it just stalls altogether, sometimes permenantly until a reboot, & sometimes for a few seconds while the (processor?) catches up.  I don't know why, the processor should be fast enough.I'm hoping I can get the sound & network... working w/ another OS.  The drivers only support Windows 7.  That's sad.  I want to see drivers for linux & XP.  Speaking of which, the OS key ID sticker under the laptop has rubbed off.  I cannot read the Windows 7 key!  So do I have to buy a whole new OS if the hard-drive goes?  Not good.What I like about it is that it has lots of ram, a big hard-disk & a huge screen for a cheap price, at least it did when I bought it.  It's one of the better laptops I've had, except for the above issues & those are BIG issues.  I'm not impressed w/ Acer at all.

I wish I would have done a more comprehensive search of user feedback on the web rather than the professional reviews of this computer.  Sure it's a good bargain, it seems fast and works ok but the piece that I missed was the overwhelming number of users who reported sticking keys.  Guess what 18 days of using my computer keys began to not work.  I was so upset, called Dell and they wanted me to replace the parts.  They were happy to "walk me through" the process.....WHAT?! I have an 18 day old non working computer and Dell wants me to do the repairs???  I balked and then they agreed that since it was within 30 days they would send a tech out.  Oh, the techs don't work evenings or weekends, and I don't have a flexible schedule.....so we set up an appointment at lunch, and the tech doesn't show, only to call me to tell me he is on his way at the point I have to be back at work.It gets better.  I am livid at this point, what a waste of money.  I froze the charge since it was all so new.  I call back Dell again and tell them that I froze the charge and want to send the computer back.  Turns out I only had 21 days from PURCHACE to send it back.  Doesn't matter I've only had the computer in my possession for 18 days; it was too late since I was over the 21 days.  I could cry.  On a limited budget I get a computer with keys that don't work and service techs that don't show up.  By the way, the last Dell rep threatened to screw my credit up if I didn't pay.....got to love that....Buyers beware.  It's all so wrong on a number of levels.

I bought this at another retailer for $500.  Not worth it.  It developed a hard drive problem after owning it for four months.  It needed to have a new hard drive installed, with all the problems and hassles that come with that process.  I'm still not sure it will last.  Do not buy this computer; do research, and pay a few hundred more dollars upfront to avoid the problem.  The tech who looked at the machine said he's seen this model develop hard drive problems within weeks of purchase.

Ever wanted to test the dreaded blue screen of death feature in a Windows notebook, look no further.  This machine comes with Vista home basic and crashed ever 5 mins, even when I would fix the driver issues.  Then I upgraded to Vista home Premium which made the system more stable for internet use but still crashed an insane amount of times.  I now use a Dell XPS which is flawless, a Macbook Pro which I have had for a year and a new 24" Imac, which  have yet to fail or error a single time.  Avoid the Dell Inspiron (this make of Inspiron anyway) it's a waste of time and money.  The hard drive's are garbage and the wireless cards used in this notebook and the XPS are terrible, zone out and fail in a month.  The keyboard is comfortable, alot like the Latitude keyboard but cheaper, and the dvd rom is brittle, flimsey junk.  Overall this is just a terrible computer in every sence.  It looks nice, with a nice design but it's a wolf in sheeps clothing, it's garbage.Highly recommend everyone avoid this notebook.

Actually I would really give it less than 1 Star.In my experience, with this computer you will need to replace the battery after 6 months or less even with LIGHT use (at the cost of $175 through Dell). Secondly, your 'Laptop' will end up becoming a 'Desktop' because the screen will quit working and you will have to borrow your screen from your desktop (unless you want to pay the $200+ to repair or replace the screen).  Thirdly, you will find out that your Desktop screen will not keep a signal  because there are no screw-in options on the side where the connection for the extra screen is.  All of this will thenleave you with the the following options: a)replace the screen b)repair the screen if it is possible to repair or c)buy the replacement part that has the screws on it so your desktop screen will keep a signal.And if that isn't enough to turn you off, no worries, because it gets worse...After all of the above, out of the clear blue sky, your hard drive will take a dive & then all you will be left with is deciding which day to take it out to the trash.To give you an idea of how common my story is with this brand, here's some searches you can Google:1) Dell Inspiron+screen black2) Dell Inspiron+screen won't come3) Dell Inspiron+battery not charging4) Dell Inspiron+won't boot upBottom Line: Unless you are looking for a way to give yourself a migraine, I would highly recommend that you steer clear of this brand altogether.

This is my saga of attempting to use Dell's extended warranty.My saga begins in January of this year.  My Dell Inspiron Notebook began to fail.  This resulted in four technicians visiting my home.  I waited for one technician on three different days until he finally showed several hours late on the fourth appointment.  The first replaced my video card, the second replaced my video card but when this did not work, he phoned and another technician came and replaced the LCD.  The third replaced the video card, the LCD, and the motherboard.  There was still a problem.  I might add that with three of these, there was a long conversation on the phone.  I am now quite good at understanding Indians speaking broken English.When my computer failed again Dell finally agreed to replace my computer.  While very frustrated, I felt at least I was making progress even though this meant I would have to reload all my programs.  My refurbished computer arrived and it was an upgrade over my old computer.  I reloaded my programs but quickly noticed a problem with the hard drive hanging up.  I could not believe Dell would send me a computer with a bad hard drive but after talking to Dell again and running a long test, the hard drive was indeed found to be bad.Dell then told me they would send a new preconfigured hard drive and it would arrive in ten working days.  I phoned again in fifteen days and they apologized that there was a technical problem and the hard drive had not been mail.  They guaranteed I would receive it in five days.  I phoned again the next day and the person could find no action had been taken but he agreed he would send the drive and it would arrive in three days but it would not be a preconfigured drive.  I would have to use the restoration disc.I phone again and they said I would receive it in two days.To be continued.

Bought mine in mid 2012. iOversensitive touchpad. Cursor jumping all over. Called Dell tech line. Took over an hour and a supervisor to improve to the point it was at least usable. Over time problem crept back. Fair correction by adjusting keyboard & cursor speed down.Meanwhile, internet research showed many others had same problem. Again, problem slowly got worse for me. Computer once more to the point of unusable. Cursor jumps all over, closing/opening pages, deleting etc. unless cursor constantly manually repositioned.Called tech line again. Now I'm out of warranty, so no help unless I cough up over a hundred bucks. Called customer servicade. Too bad too sad, Pay or no help.Complaints about this issue go back to 2009. Dell knows it is a major issue. It has been an ongoing issue for me since buying the computer. They should have a free fix available for a problem THEY created.Otherwise, I loved this little laptop. But it is just a paperweight now.

The laptop I purchased had much more wear and tear than advertised. It had lots of scuffs and some writing in marker on the bottom of the laptop. Had I known this I wouldn't have bought the laptop. Do not recommend this seller.

The laptop they sent was an i3 processor, had disfunctional keys, and only 3gb  and now my gf is pretty disappointed that the laptop i got for her was a piece of garbage

the item is a faulty one. i just got a new replacement from dell but the first one is just a dead box fro me

Not usable until you upgrade all drivers, the OS to windows 8.1 and buy the max possible memory at crucial.

bought this laptop last week. Day one of use, the laptop shut down no less than 6 times. Second day of use, last night, lap top shut down 4 times, ususally after 15-20 min of use.

Had 2 months..Computer blacks out and cannot get screen back unless I unplug, take out battery and restart....Support was useless..wants me to pay for service contract. NEVER BUY DELL AGAIN.

First the sound is only audible when it is turn up to 100 % and it is of poor quality.  Windows 8 is extremely hard to use, even with the tour.  I can't find anything on it.  I looked for Applications to get the calculator, applications does not exist on windows 8. The quality of the screen isn't there either.  I had a Dell Inspiron 17 7010 series, which was less expensive than this and loved it.  I am so sorry I purchased this laptop.  I can't use it for anything but to check email and read the news.  Don't waste your money on a windows 8 pc.

I bought this review because of the excellent specs for a fairly reasonable price. I had this laptop for no more than a month when a bright pixel appeared on the LED screen. Since the sticker on the box said "0 bright dot guarantee", I didn't really worry about it. However, after contacting customer service, I was told that the "0 Bright dot guarantee" only covered you if you hade 5 or more bright dots. I don't know how my definition of 0 managed to be different than Asus's, but being basically told to go screw myself after spending $1500 on a gaming laptop makes me sick to my stomach. So now I can just walk into dark rooms in games, and say hello to my little green dot that apparantly "Does not impact the perfomance of the machine". Just a horrible annoyance that will ensure that if I purchase another gamning laptop, it will ASBOLUTELY not come from Asus!

Really nice laptop. Quality gaming laptop with top performance.  Up to today I would always recommend Asus for most of their product line.purchased 12/17. Gave it to my son for Christmas 12/25. on 1/11, I had to rma the whole laptop to get a windows activation issue resolved because it was policy not to provide product keys. Didn't get the laptop back until 1/28. on 2/8 I call because the power adaptor has stopped working.  I verified that it was the adaptor by replacing it with one from another Asus laptop with the same power specs. First I was required to argue with the agent about if the product was under warranty(because Dec to Feb is always more that 90days) but he would gladly sell me a new adaptor. Finally agreed that an in warranty rma was justified. Explain to me how it would happen exactly as before and we would be down for another 2+ weeks. When I asked if we could do something to make it faster like some sort of advanced replacement, I was told no.  I asked to talk to a supervisor because I figured since this was the second issue a higher level of service was warranted. Robert a supervisor in the support department told me that was policy. oh and what the agent didn't make clear is they wanted me to send in the entire laptop again because the adaptor doesn't have a part # or serial #.  If that didn't annoy me, while I was looking at the adaptor I noticed it had a part # ADP-150NB D  and right below that is a serial number. Did Robert like that? Didn't matter policy is policy I can send everything in if I wanted a replacement.  Their policy saved them money, I will take the $50 it cost to ship the laptop the first time and buy a generic power adaptor. And not ask them to do anything.I may have bought refurbished but service is universal. I don't think the service would have been different if I had spent the $1250 on a new laptop than $1250 I spent on the refurbished one.

Do NOT deal with Asus. If you ever have any problems with your laptop you can expect ludicrous long, and multiple repairs. I have a G75 that has been serviced by their repair contractor abroad as it broke while I was on vacation. Their international warranty is a total joke. My laptop had to go in for faulty speakers, gpu/motherboard, monitor, wifi module, and an ac adapter problem which caused the case to melt around the ac-in cover. After about 3 weeks those things were fixed and I got it back with a messed up audio card, and the psu died as soon as I plugged it in. I sent it back in and it has now been almost SIX weeks and there is still no expected completion date. Their repair contractor has submitted an application to have the cost of the laptop credited back to me as Asus hasn't been able to provide them with the necessary parts in almost six weeks! I haven't had my laptop up and running since July, and they've done absolutely NOTHING to remedy the situation. Save yourself the hassle and go with Samsung, Alienware, MSI, or whatever other manufacturer, but stay FAR away from Asus. After purchasing 3 of their "high end" gaming laptops I will never deal with this company for the rest of my life, and will recommend anyone I talk to to do the same.

So far I have been extremely satisfied with this computer, but I may have a lemon, more on that later.  First, the basics:The package arrived on time, and in good condition.  The computer was very simple to start, and setup to my desires.  The video card needed an updated driver, but everything else was up to date.  There was some "fluff" software, but nothing too annoying.  The computer looks sharp, and most settings are easily changed.  I especially liked the backlit keyboardGraphically, the computer works great.  Its able to run most games on the highest, or second highest setting.  I ran Skyrim, heavily loaded with high-res texture mods with no issues at all.  Nvidia is also extremely easy to deal with if you're unfamiliar with drivers and software.Sound wise, this computer is a bit of a failure, though not in a "game breaking" way.  The speakers are lackluster, and don't put out too much sound.  The computer also has an awful time recognizing sound hardware.  If you're in the middle of a game, and your SO asks you to kill the sound, your only option is to mute it (which is easy given shortcut keys on the keyboard), or to exit the game, and put in headphones.  The laptop will not input any already running sound into the headphones, so you must completely shut down whatever game/video/program, you're running, put in headphones, then restart.  Even then you will occasionally get sound on both the speakers, and headphones, forcing another full restart.If you'd have asked me what I thought about this laptop two weeks ago, I would have said 4 stars.  Its a great computer, that runs fantastically, for a reasonable price.  However, exactly one week after the manufacturer warranty expired my computer refused to start.  While I am not an expert, I believe the BIOS card has broken.  Luckily I had purchased a warranty (via square trade, so far service has been great).  Even if I hadn't purchased a warranty, I am confident that Amazon.com would repair/replace it given how close it is to the original warranty.  Nonetheless, it is unacceptable for a product this expensive, to have such a fundamental failure, so early in its service life.While I will continue to use this computer if it can be repaired, I definitely won't purchase an ASUS again, and I strongly recommend any one thinking of purchasing this laptop to get am extended warranty with it.

When I was underway, I bought the LAPTOP a few days after it came out (my first ASUS product). Worked and looked amazing. Very impressed with the performance and looks. Was playing SKYRIM like a CHAMP with no lag what so ever. About a month and a half I went to turn it on, broken. The keyboard lights would light up and attempt to fully power up but it would shut off after a few seconds. The screen wouldn't turn on. What really pissed me off is that you have to pay out of pocket to ship your product to a service center. If I pay $1500 for an FN laptop, the company should ship you a no shipping cost box. I will never buy an ASUS product again. Oh, the issue with my laptop was a bad Mother Board. On a positive note, they repaired and shipped it back fast but will never by from again.-Dave

Overall, the computer is amazing. I love the raw speed and its large memory size.What kills me about this product is the SCREEN!!!! On the product description, it says that this is a 1920 x 1080 hd screen. Well, let me tell you, the screen is no where close to that. The pixels on the screen are very noticeable, i have tried to tweek all the contrast ratio and resolution changes, even at the highest 1920 x 1080 resolution, the screen looks like looking though a "bug screen" that you use to keep bugs out of your room.The pixels are less noticeable on dark images, however, especially on white backgrounds such as web most web pages, and visual studio, the perfectly square pixels are very noticeable. The perfectly horizontally and vertically align pixels are more than enough to drive a person insane!!!I don't know if its just this product or the particular laptop that i revived, but i am not taking the chance by replacing my current one with another one of this.

Don't buy this computer!!  It has only one good point. The processor is very fast but beyond that i find nothing to recommend it.  The mouse pad often times does not respond to touch and the screen display is constantly resizing itself for no apparent reason. If I barely touch the ASD and F keys similataineously all kind of wierd things happen to the display.  (screen goes to black, or resizes itself, or  the text jumps around on the page, or the curser wont work.  It is really a bare bones computer with a fast processor.  Trying to turn audio up or down is maddening.  There is no number lock light or caps lock light.  The display picture quality is very disappointing.  Video that looks great on other computers or tablets looks washed out and grainy on this thing.  I  even sent the first one back and the replacement was exactly the same.  I think ASUS figures kids will be buying this thing and as long as games work well, they wont notice all the other problems

The screen died after 2 days and the whole screen has to be replaced. Even if you have warranty, it is very inconvienent to have to post it back to Asus and not be able to use it. Don't buy this if you are going to use it for buisness or study. It could cost you a lot. The cost of a large parcel for a 5kg item is expensive and it adds extra cost. This whole experience has been very costly for me. I have a 5 year old Compaq Presario, that I'm forced to use and its still working, but Asus died after 2 days. It's pathetic.Look at all the topics on the Asus ROG forum and other reviews complaining about the sound. I discovered that myself. When you plug the headphones in, the speaker keeps working when you don't want it to. Asus hasn't done a thing about this.A lot of people check out the negative reviews before they buy something and I hope this negative review will cost Asus thousands of dollars in lost buisness, that is the least they deserve. I'm stuck with this lemon for the next few years. This laptop is like a coffin, it looks good on the outside, but it's rotten on the inside.

I just purchased it online few weeks ago and it is no longer good.  Every time I use it or watch DVD, it always stop or hung and I have to start all over again.

I tried a few ways by searching google , it looks like a software glitch. But it happened again after I "solves" the battery problem.

This item is listed as a Quad Core 2.3 GHz in the description however when we got the item it is a single 2.4 GHz.  After we received it we looked further down and there is a second description for it as a 2.4 GHz but what we looked at was the description at the top, right by the price, listing it as a Quad Core.  My son was very upset by this, he is a big gamer and was expecting, well, what we thought we ordered.  They need to correct the description or send us the quad core!We of course can and will return it but again, just upset that we didn't get what we ordered, what was listed in the description.

This laptop purchased in Sept 2012 for nearly $1,400 and registered with ASUS is defective and needs to be returned. It is now booting into a black screen, which is typically a hardware issue. We hear Windows complete startup, so it is likely a bad LVDS cable connection, bad cable, electrical short, or faulty power supply. Apparently other users have encountered this same issue.Regardless of the cause, we now to exchange the defective laptop for a new unit. I do not wish to, nor should I, deal with an RMA. And I do not want wait for ASUS to repair a brand new laptop. I want one that works or I will accept the refund if this model is out of stock.Amazon is refusing to refund or replace as we are past their "Oct. 14" refund deadline despite the fact that this is defective merchandise, and a particularly expensive electronic item.  I will also complain via the BBB and any other agency available to me andI would advise any potential buyer to think twice before placing an order for this or any other electronic item offered by Amazon over $300.

I just got this laptop and tried to play a song on youtube and i got the blue screen of death when the bass went too high. otherwise looks great, feels lighter than g74 . fit and finish is excellent. I will update in a few days if i get the problem again.(update)the subwoofer completely stopped working. I am really disappointed. I've asked for a replacement. Giving asus one last tryThings just got worse. Games were running great until now, now the same games on low setting are lagging.

Cheap plastic, poor hadware, auto restarting, high price, i really suggest you switch to another brand, regreted shopping! This product should be cancelled.

pros-somewhat decent screen-good overall performancecons-poor audio quality-horrible track pad-cheap keys-poor customer supportPurchased this laptop to replace my aging, but still great, hp dragon.This Asus was disappointing from the moment I took it from the box.The screen is okay, but no where near my lower resolution five year old hp dragon or any of its competitors for that matter ie. msi,dell or Samsung. The speakers are horrible even though they added a sub woofer. The worst part of my experience with this Asus, and the reason I have returned it, was the faulty audio andtrack pad.I took the time to look at a number of the newer ivy bridge laptops in store and I have already ordered a msi gt70 because of the better screen,audio, and gpu for the same price. The only bright side to this story is the excellent service I received through amazon as usual.

Like another reviewer, I've also had started having problems the AC adaptor and the battery.  It will cycle between AC and DC power at random.  I don't know if this is because of the placement of the adaptor and me consistently bumping up against it because of this bad placement, or some other reason.  The metal end of the power adaptor will get extremely hot to the touch as well.  I honestly don't know how long this laptop will last and it really bugs me that I'm expecting this unit to fail after only having it a few months.  It's still under warranty and I will get this fixed, but it is a huge inconvenience to lose my laptop for a couple of weeks (again) for a second repair in the time that I've owned it.  I do regret my purchase decision and will waste no additional money on ASUS products in the future.

Recieved this laptop and the packaging was perfect, no signs of damage. Turned it on and downloaded Skype, closed the screen and switched rooms. When i opened the screen back up it was pure white! Nothing i could do to fix it. Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement which took about a week. When i received the new one, its screen showed nothing but black. I could hear windows load up through the speakers but couldnt see anything.Apparently on this model they made the cable that attaches the screen to the board about 1mm to short. This comes from a local repair tech who has dealt with this before. Being to short they are subject to extra stress on the pivot point and the connectors. Some even break during shipping straight from the factory, others never break. He said that Asus knows about it but refuses to acknowledge it as a manufacturing defect. He said he has repaired at least 20 of these and they all have come back with the same problem again. Apparently there is a 1.5mm longer cable you can get if you can find it on ebay or something. But i just sent it back and am now buying an Alienware. Its a little bit more money but a better screen and something i can trust.

When it runs, it's great.I got my first one on Nov 30. It died after the first set of Windows updates; loud pop noise, bsod, and never booted again. 2nd one after Amazon replaced it, worked from Dec 1 - Jan 9. No pop, but started getting a lot of bsods, then finally died. The BSOD always referred to the video card.

Day 1 recieved item in a timely manner/ Day 2 had to send to Asus for repairs (1) did not down load all the drivers,(2) could not make a back-up disc because it had no partition,(3) would keep getting black screen and could not shut down,had to take out battery to shut down!  then had to pay fed-x for box to ship item but Amazon refunded me the cost!!! thank you  Recieved lap top back in 7 days, tried laptop again! this time (1) hard still did not have a partition, so no back up could be made and (2) touchpad stopped working, so 4 days later the laptop was sent out again! and 7 days later it returned! Asus replaced the hard drive this time and did something to fix the touchpad!! but the story does not end there! Its past the 30 day return time now and to some reason i decieded to campare what i bought to another Asus, Well the hard drives that where replace only add up to 671 and it had a 750, also came with 12gb installed memory and now it only has 8gb installed memory so now i have to find out what Asus will do about it (IF ANYTHING)ASUS G53SX-DH71 Full HD 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop - Republic of Gamers (Black)

Long winded. Bear with me.I purchased this laptop on 11/22/2012 because it seemed like an affordable option for my needs when I decided to go back to college. Honestly, I really hadn't had any issues with it until recently. About a week ago, I noticed that my battery icon had a red x over it, when I mouse over the icon it says it is plugged in and charging, but there is no charge on the battery, no matter how long I leave it plugged in. It won't turn on without the cord plugged in. Clearly, the battery is completely dead.I decide just to make sure, I'll have my husband double check. He works in IT for a large medical technology company, so surely he can determine if its the battery or some other malfunction. After going through the HP website for assistance and installing the "HP Support Assistant" software, he begins swearing loudly at my laptop. I inquire as to why, and he simply shows me my screen. The program has little boxes where the text is supposed to be, so it is completely useless.I figured it'd be okay, I'd contact HP, surely a battery isn't supposed to flat line within a year, right? I went through the steps to validate my warranty, and it turns out mine expired 8/29/13. Okay. Still no big deal. I'll just email a technician or begin a chat with them to see what steps I need to follow to have this repaired. I really feel I shouldn't have this problem at all, but at this point, I am willing to pay a little just to have the problem fixed.Fun fact? You can't contact their support staff about your product if it is out of warranty! Want to search for a new battery for the machine just to get an idea of how expensive replacing it will be? There's none listed! Now I have passed the point of angry. I am telling you, do not buy an HP unless you enjoy receiving no help when something goes awry. I am also telling this to all of my friends, and my husband is telling this to all of his coworkers-- don't buy HP.

It would not boot up when I got it,  I called HP and they could not get it to boot up either.

I bought this machine nearly a year ago. After first few months the left side of the screen split. It was still in warranty so i sent it back for repair (i should have insisted on a replacement). The screen split exactly the same way soon after i received it back, only by this time it was out of warranty. There is a problem with the hardware that other people with this model have faced too. The customer service is not at all helpful and refuses to acknowledge the defect with the model.

Light, beautiful design and fairly fast but very poorly build!I was initially happy with this product when i first got it 4 month ago but am already starting to have problems with the screen, it is cracking off from the left side! I am not a heavy duty user, just simple and careful home use but this laptop is truly cheaply build. I didn't expect HP to build something for that way but they  did! Very disappointing. would had been better picking some other brand for a higher price.

The machine is great and I know that. Hardware specs are awesome and I got a free Battlefield 4 game for my purchase, sweet.I knew the risks of buying a "cheap" laptop from outside the U.S., but did not expect this:1.- Right out of the package I opened the laptop and *clack*... left hinge broken... are you kidding me?2.- IT CAME WITH NO OS!!!! NO OS AT ALL!!! Can't boot my laptop because it came with no freaking OS!!! Unbelievable.I'm contacting Amazon and/or Acer right now... I'll edit my post to add a support review. So far I'm frustrated and dissapointed

This 'new' machine was delivered to us with an existing virus.  The machine was corrupted with malware and was unusable.  Unfortunately, it did just enough to connect to the internet, hook to our home network  and potentially infect our other machines (which thankfully were protected by anti-malware systems), before it became completely unusable.  Very frustrating.

Beware of computer that already has a virus on it! 2 days now I've been trying to get rid of the conduit site  seems to HIJACK my homepage! This computer would have gotten a better rating if it wasn't for[...] for the homepage! You have to manually take out the virus! Norton will not find it under its antivirus! You have to use power erase to find it........ If this doesn't work I'm going to return this computer!

I bought this computer so I would have a smaller one for traveling.  The keyboard is much smaller than a regular keyboard (which is expected) but is so small that I'm always hitting the wrong keys.  Also I've have many problems with the touch screen feature and the computer switching screens while I'm in the middle of typing.  (That gets very annoying when you're typing a work doc and a Netflix movie just starts playing.)  I've owned other HP computers before and never had a problem with them as I do this on.  Maybe I just got a lemon..

I found background light on Upper right corner on screen. So I got damaged Item, I am not sure how to review it.

this model has very bad keyboard. It constantly connected and disconnected, making it impossible to type anything, even to login my laptop. never buy sumsung again.

I got my laptop and have had problems from day one, when you ask for help you get a very rude response with no help, I have had to pay someone to repair my laptop. They person who responses to your help email only blames you for the problem. Which I had my computer checked out by a repair guy only to find the mother board is bad in the computer. I would not recommend anybody buy this computer. Oh and if you do don't forget you only have 30 days to make sure it works properly.

I had this laptop for only a year and it bit the dust.  Started turning off on its own very frequently, then started rebooting itself, then the backlight went out and then eventually it would only be on for about 40 seconds at a time.  I know they're older and refurbished but this was a major bummer.  Like I said, only lasted a year.  Instead of dumping money into it I suggest buying a new one and financing it instead.  It's not worth it.

I love APPLE products, but I think the model i bought is bad because my brother bought the same 2006 model and his is doing poorly as well.The problems:1) battery died.2) the fan is very loud, and I don't get bothered with noise so that is saying something.3) the processor is getting slower, and slower.My recommendation is to get a newer model. I like saving money by getting older cheaper models, but in the long run, it seems like i'm spending more money by replace them because they break down faster.

The price is great but you get Garbage. Within 1 week of buying I see that the keys on the keyboard stops working. You will hit a J and it thinks you are trying to do F2 or screen swap. The only way to get out of this is to log off and log back in. The hot keys at the top of the keyboard are swapped. So F5 does not do refresh. I have never been able to successfully connect wirelessly with my printer. Now after about 2 years, entire folders disappear. What do I mean by that? Well you can go to Windows Explorer (file manager) and you can go to your My documents folders and you can see your "Kids" folder (as an example) but if you write a word document and then go to save it, the "kids" folder within your My documents folder cannot be seen. So what I have to do is save it to my desktop and then move it manually to the kids folder. This also means that for the most part if I want to send an email with an attachment I need to save to the file to my desktop to ensure I will be able to find the file to attach to the email for sending. I bought this laptop brand new and before this I had a Compaq Presario CQ60 that went bad a few short years after buying brand new. I am really starting to think I should avoid all HP laptops all together.

I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE IT FOR 2 Wks and it stopped working. Not Happy at all. Would not recommend at all.

Two months of owning this computer the screen started blinking in and out. After being on the phone with them for an hour, we decided to send it in for repair. I use this computer for business and had important information on it that I was unable to backup. They said they would back everything up for me at no charge. After a week I received the computer back with a note on it saying they could not fix it. I called Dell support. They informed me since I had information I didn't want erased, they could not work on it. I explained what I was told prior to sending it in. They said for $120.00 they would back everything up. I was on the phone with them for 3 1/2 hours. I was transfered to 9 different people. After being on the phone they realized that everything on the computer was already erased! Since they felt so horrible, they decided they would send someone out to the house to replace the hard drive. Lets hope this computer does not break again! Very upset! I would not buy this computer!

I purchased this notebook a few months ago and hadn't used it much because Windows 8 was so counterintuitive and difficult to use.  Yesterday, I went to use it for a project and the computer wouldn't start.  I got a message asking me to install an operating system!  I then spent half the afternoon on the phone with HP's customer support.  While pleasant, the technicians could do nothing to help me and HP refuses to refund my money or to send a replacement PC.  They want me to take time off of work to have a technician come over to replace the hard drive.  This is not my problem and HP should be embarrassed to sell such deficient products.  I am a loyal Mac user, and Apple would have made it right.  This is my first and will be my last HP notebook purchase.  Save yourselves some trouble and alot of money by choosing another notebook.

Windows 8 is the AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would not have purchase this if I knew how bad windows 8 is. DO NOT buy anything with windows 8!

I bought this because I've looked at other Asus laptops with Nvidia cards that had great graphics and looked well made.  This is a little cheaper laptop than the ones I looked at, but it looks and feels a lot cheaper.  On top of that, one of the hinges on the lid was popped out and the video card didn't work.  I would probably still consider an Asus if I wanted to spend $1,000 or more, but I wouldn't buy one of their less expensive ones even in the $700 or $800 range.

I purchased this model as Christmas gift for my kid.I'm a big fan of ASUS, using more than 10 ASUS Laptops.It is my 1st trouble with ASUS laptops.I return the defective one and ordered the same model today.Wish next one is defective free.

Computer has never worked. Screen is black only. Price was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for!

NEED A OPERATING MAUNAL ON HOW TO OPERATE THIS PRODUCT. NO CLUE WHAT SO EVER.  NO CLUE AT ALL ON HOW TO OPERATE IT.

If you want to buy an iBook, buy a faster one.  This one just can't run any modern software.  Heck, it isn't much good for old software.  Go for the 700MHZ G3 or don't bother!  If you need to run any graphics software then buy a G4.  My G3 can't hack Adobe anything!  If I could go back I would buy a G4 based Powerbook (I use one at work).

NOT SATISFIED WITHNTHIS PRODUCT AT ALL. CAN NOT ACCESS THE INTERNET NO MATTER WHAT I TRY AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY HELP FROM THE SELLER NOR A REFUND FOR THE PRODUCT

still no comment  not happy. I don't want to say anything bad. So I was just saying and no, comment .

I purchased this item advertised as Used which is fine with me as I'm on a budget. The price is deal breaker. Beware though I just got it whole shipping was reasonable time the product Piece of junk. In comments Now the want to tell me it's only for parts doesn't even work plus no charger. So here I have this useless old laptop and negativa pockets Merry Christmas to me. Do not buy ANYTHING.... I only took the time to post this to prevent someone else's LoSS.

I really do not like the product that I got. It is not willing to connect to the internet, i've tried numerous ways. The screen does not want to turn on unless its in a certain position which makes it impossible to type and read at the same time. I am really disappointed in this product.

I am EXTREMELY disappointed and feel cheated. The computer turned on for all of 10 minutes and I have not been able to turn it on since then! What a waste of my hard earned limited income! I will NEVER buy another used electronic item. I feel like I just gave my money away!

I absolutely hate this product. I'm a single parent and bought this as a Christmas gift for my 2 sons. I never thought that a laptop in this day would not have a wireless card. They were so excited to finally have their first computer. Needless to say, they haven't touched it since the day after Christmas. It was a complete waste of my money and I can't afford to replace it! I would never recommend this product to anyone.

If you want to buy an iBook, buy a faster one.  This one just can't run any modern software.  Heck, it isn't much good for old software.  Go for the 700MHZ G3 or don't bother!

The good parts first: It is nice looking when it is off. It is easy to set up, the sound quality is good, the documentation is good. In the dark, the display is excellent.Now the bad part: the screen is so incredibly shiny that it is very difficult to use because of all the glare. Even room light cause reflections and glare, so it works best in the dark. It is difficult to use in a lighted room and unusable outside.The Touch Pad is incredible sensitive and I find that I need an external mouse to do useful work.Save the aggravation and buy a PC with a matte finish screen.EDIT: One year later and I haven't smashed this POS to pieces with a hammer. But I have been tempted on many occasions. Over time it has gotten slower and slower and slower. I keep it clean using CCleaner, I have trimmed down all the startup apps using Microsoft's Autoruns, it is free from spyware, malware and viruses, I have uninstalled device drivers that are unused, and I have removed ALL the Sony bloatware and demos that it came loaded with. That alone freed up almost 90 GB!!! I have formatted the hard drive and started from scratch with a fresh install of the operating system and all the drivers. It is still slow. For example, switching from the desktop to the start screen is a timed 5 second task. Switching users (there are 3, with minimal profiles) takes 30-45 seconds. Loading Word 2013 from the desktop - 20 seconds, from the start screen - almost a minute.Installing the Windows 8.1 Update 1 was an all day deal that ultimately forced me to roll back all the previous Windows updates back to February. While this isn't Sony's fault, that fact that it took all day is partially due to the slow hard drive and processing speed of the laptop.I am convinced at this point that there is either a flaw in the BIOS, or a conflict with one of the Sony drivers for either the touchscreen, the Bluetooth radio, the hard drive, or the ridiculous Touch Pad. The disk drive is always in use and at least 25% of the CPU capacity is always being used by a process or service that I am unable to identify. I'm pretty good with PCs myself, and I've also had it looked at by Geek Squad, and two corporate PC techs doing me a favor and none of them can identify what is using the processor so much.I replaced this PC with an HP Elitebook a few months ago. The HP is twice as fast, half the cost, and came with far less bloatware. It is a little heavier than the VAIO. I have since given this VAIO to my 3rd grade kid who uses it to make pretty pictures with Paint and fools around with PowerPoint. She thinks it's great, but it's no good for serious business unless serious business for you means watching videos, listening to music, and drawing shapes in Paint. If I ever get bored, I'm going to try installing Ubuntu on it and see if that performs like a dog too.This is without a doubt, the very last Sony PC I will ever buy, and remains the worst PC I have ever owned. I would give it zero stars if I could.

The Surface Pro is a 5 star device. I am giving this a low score because it's NOT what they said it was.This is NOT A SURFACE PRO 2This is NOT A 4th GEN HASWELL CPUThis is NOT WINDOWS 8.1 (but it is admittedly a free upgrade)I expected a good deal on a Surface Pro 2, I ended up overpaying for a Surface Pro 1.

As many people who pre-ordered this tablet know, it did not begin to ship until a month after Samsung's announced release date of October 26th.  There were obviously some build issues, otherwise the tablet would not have been delayed without reason by Samsung.I received my tablet on Friday the 23rd.  After connecting the keyboard dock, I turned it on.  The initial boot was insanely fast, but shortly after it began constantly playing the connect and disconnect chime due to the keyboard not being able to stay connected for more than a second or so.I contacted Samsung on Saturday, and after multiple transfers, disconnected calls, and rude customer service reps, I made it to "Tablet Support".  It became obvious that the tech support rep did not even know that Samsung made a tablet that ran Windows 8.  He constantly tried to correct me by saying it must be running Android or Windows 7.  When I assured him it had Windows 8, he accused me of upgrading the computer myself since "it came with Windows 7" and that Samsung would not longer support the computer.  I decided to quit arguing with him, and simply pointed out it was a hardware issue with the keyboard, so the operating system did not matter.  He agreed, and put me on hold without any further questions for 30 minutes until my call was suddenly disconnected.After calling back, I reached another rep and immediately asked for a supervisor.  The supervisor asked what the issue was, and after I mentioned the keyboard constantly disconnecting, he said it would need to be sent in for repair.  Just to note, Samsung did not try ANY troubleshooting, which leads me to believe this is a known issue.So, that brings me to their repair process.  I had to ship the computer to Samsung via UPS Ground, which will take 8 days.  I shipped the computer on the morning of the 26th, and it is estimated to take until the 4th to deliver from California to Texas.  I really loathe UPS Ground.  Samsung quoted 5-7 business days for repair, and then they will only ship the computer via UPS Ground back to me.All in all, I waited 1.5 months for delivery, only to receive a broken tablet with the same issues as many other reviewers.  I will have to wait 8 days for the computer to be shipped to Samsung, another 5-7 days for repair, and probably 7-8 days for it to be shipped back.  It is quite pathetic for a company to think 20+ days to repair a brand new computer is acceptable, but that appears to be the norm for Samsung.

I have held off putting a review out of this machine until I couldn't take it anymore.  It is officially time to stop putting it off.  This "computer"/"tablet"/"whatever" is the biggest piece of junk that I have ever owned.  Samsung should be ashamed of itself for putting a product like this out.  I have returned it twice for manufacturing defects and now find that it needs to be fixed again.  I can't complain about the customer service to date because they have been responsive (a saving grace on buying future items from Samsung).  First it was the display....they replaced it, then it was the docking station....they fixed it, now it is the display again....haven't done a ticket for that yet because ENOUGH ALREADY.  Time to get a computer I don't have to send back every couple of months.The idea of this machine is great but I am afraid Samsung just couldn't pull this one off.  Where is that Customer Support Number again....oh, yeah, I have it memorized.

The first unit I got would barely ever detect the keyboard connection. After returning it, getting a new one, and then having to send that one back to Samsung to "fix" that issue (as well as the battery, which did after barely any use, leaving the tablet literally unusable when not plugged in), the keyboard will usually work - IF it is placed flat (not being held), and I manually disconnect and reconnect. Still very inconvenient when you have to mess with it constantly to make it work, or have plugged the charger into the keyboard port and are expecting a full charge, only to realize it wasn't electrically connected.Two big frustrations which hobble what would be an otherwise great product.

When I received my pro13, I found that a usb port is bad! Four metal strips, one of which is broken. When I insert any device to the usb port, the system show "USB device not recognized"!

I received this laptop for work and initially loved it. It is very light weight and has an extremely slim profile. Additionally the battery life is very impressive and can go nearly all day on battery if the brightness of the screen is turned down. The keyboard feels good and I don't have any difficulty typing on it and it doesn't seem particularly cheap. The 1080p screen also gives a very gorgeous display for a laptop. I loved it for the first month or so I had it.So why the 1 star review? Whether it be Sony or Windows 8/8.1 this laptop is near unusable. Due to either driver issues or OS issues with the model and Windows 8/8.1 if the laptop is not plugged in it will crash either randomly on it's own or when the lid is closed. Occasionally after crashing it will not turn back on unless plugged in. Other times it will shut off once unplugged as if there is no battery in the laptop. I have contacted Sony who replaced the battery which did nothing to alleviate the problem which occurs on both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Googling the issue turns up forums of people who claim their specific model was fixed by a graphics update (did not work on mine) or that it is simply and ongoing issue between Microsoft and Sony.Final verdict: Given the price tag of this line of laptops STAY AWAY. For half the price you could get something 100x more reliable.

I bought a sony VAIO pro 13 with datavision seller ( really no problems with this seller,very good service), inmediatly that I tried to initial configuration the wifi signal drops each five minutes.I tried ANYTHING for to resolve this Little big problem, nothing, and I followed each step that SONY tecnical support online give me, without any solution.No one Word from SONY tecnical support or costumer service about fixing or software update.Worst.... I tried with sony VAIO pro 11 with the local seller.... AND THE SAME PROBLEM ???  HOLLY GOD!!!them I searched in the web, for to find that this problem is the same WORLDWIDE![...]I'm a loyal user from sony, but with this bug, in the future I'll avoid to buy a VAIO laptopUnexcusable this class of issues from a High level company so like Sony

Looks great - but worst nightmare to deal with bluetooth/drivers/hdmi connectivity issues -Sony is going down because of the way they want to make money with their proprietary crap!!No wonder Apple kicked them out ...

I've had it for less than a month and had nothing but problems.  We've been on the phone with Microsoft and Gateway more than we've been able to use the computer.  Problems include crashing, freezing, a string of virus messages and now it doesn't even boot up.  Just gets to the 'Gateway' screen and blinks.  I'll pay more for a quality device next time.

Works beautifully if plugged into the wall.  On battery it disconnects every ten minutes or the second i plug in my iphone.  All the known power saving settings problems are addressed: setup F2 to latest defaults, latest wireless adapter configured so it does not let windows disconnect for power saving, windows 7 up to date.  Case 1778026 if other Asus techs are reading this.  The last Asus tech I got assigned to (I talked to three because they will not wait five minutes to see if their solution works) , who in all fairness did wait at my request, after seeing that her last attempt did not work, said that they could not do anything else about it.  When I said that there is no option for me but to return it then, she agreed, apologizing.  Replacement was not suggested, which leads me to believe that this is a known problem for which they do not have a fix yet.  I have two new $400 HP pavilions notebooks with same power working beautifully on my home network, with windows 7, albeit a bit uglier looking.  That tells you that it's nice for a notebook to be beautiful with all solid hardware, but does not do you any good if it cannot perform a basic function, in this case connect to wireless, consistently in the marketplace.  I'm glad I bought it thru Amazon, their return process is flawless.

This laptop is very, very slow. Some times the computer will register that you typed something and some times it won't. If you want to do simple internet browsing on one window (forget having multiple up!) then you are looking at the wrong computer. If you click on a Windows 8 app, then likely you will have to repeat the process three times for the computer to go into the app. The app store is useless because the computer won't let you login. The USB 3 ports read as if they were original USB ports - slow.I ran a malware program right out of the box and found that there wasn't any. I reinstalled Windows 8, then Windows 8.1 and nothing sped up the computer at all. It's simply put - a piece of crap. The price is astronomically priced for what the capabilities are. I literally could do nothing but stare at the computer for the days that I had it. I had IT play with it as well and came up with no other alternatives except to return it.If you really can't afford much for a laptop, get something on Ebay or a refurbished machine for 50% to 75% less than this computer in your community.

We bought this for an employee to use as a burn computer. Turns out, the capabilities don't even fall in line with that. Would not recommend.

This computer broke down twice within the first four months.  Samsung ships your computer to a third party vendor for repair and it can take a month or more to get it back each time.  The second time I sent it in, it was returned unrepaired.  Thankfully the retailer allowed me to exchange it for a different brand.  I understand that any manufacturer can turn out a computer that breaks down, but how this company handles its warranty service is terrible. I don't recommend anyone buy a computer from this company, but if you do and anything breaks down, don't send it in for warranty service if you can return it.

Got a refurbished Toshiba satellite of a slightly different model. Computer went to sleep automatically despite settings telling it not to go to sleep. After 3 months of sending it in for repairs (4X total), and sloppy repair jobs that ruined the keyboard Toshiba finally agreed to replace the laptop with a satellite P875-S7102. This computer worked fine for about a week, then the same problem appeared (going to sleep randomly). I don't have the time and money (paying for shipping to send the laptop in for repair gets expensive after multiple repairs) to go through this whole process again.Lesson: Toshiba is willing knowingly to sell its customers defective laptops.Total costs for the barely functional defective laptop I have now:Original laptop cost: $590Software lost due to system resets during repairs: $500 (MS Office 2010, MS Office 2013, STATA)Shipping costs: $25Hours spent on the phone with tech support and customer service: 40 hours X 20$/hour - $800Total cost of defective laptop: $1,915Never again Toshiba.

Final Update 6: I have dropped the rating to a 1 star, while the specs may be nice, you can get better spec'ed laptops for about the same price. They will probably last you a lot longer. I've had 2 warranty repairs in the first year of ownership and now the reliability has taken another hit, where the graphics card likes to crash on occasion, even after installing different drivers and such. I finally attempted a Windows 7 re-install and things seem to be running ok, though with 1 crash since the redo it makes me question it,but I haven't really used it too much as I NEED reliability. So I ended up getting a new Laptop. Better spec'ed and better built by far. Plus it was a little cheaper. Samsung also seems to have abandoned the Gamer series as there has been no Haswell refresh of the Gamer Series, where Asus, Alienware, even Toshiba has done refreshes and everything. When I bought this laptop, I expected it to last me at least 2 years, if not longer as the specs where higher than I needed at the time. (I expect this out of all laptops I buy. Since I tend to buy while thinking ahead.) Instead, it's been about a year and 3 months. It's now out of warranty, and I will not spend ANYMORE money on this laptop. It's just not worth it since the reliability is the most important thing to me and it's the one thing in question.With all these updates I CANNOT recommend this laptop with the reliability issues I have had. To be fair I probably got a lemon, but also with everything else newer that has come out I can't recommend it. With this being said I will not be doing any more updates until it actually dies. (Even then it may be awhile before I update it as it's not at the top of my todo list.) I am still a student, and almost done with classes, but still use the computer for so much more. I can't have reliability issues. I have owned Asus before this and while I've had small issues here and there. They were ALWAYS fixable, but when primary parts fail like in this one. (Cpu first time, gpu second time and now maybe a third time and it's no longer under warranty.)Will this marks the end of this part, read on for the whole shebang, but this is the most up to date one.Update 5: I received my laptop back on June 14th (2013) after about 2 weeks of waiting. (This includes shipping it to them, which cost me another $50) It is running like new again. I added a star since the repair went pretty quick and seems good. I may add 1 more star if this lasts longer than that last repair (which was in November, so it was like 7 months.) I won't be giving 5 stars no matter what as this issue has soured my thoughts on Samsung now. (And I think I may be generous with the 4 stars, but I am also keeping in mind I may have gotten duds.) Again, 2 repairs in less than a year? It makes me question the lifespan of the laptop. Performance wise it's great, but it may go bad again, only time will tell and if it happens I will be completely re-writing my review from scratch. I really, really want to love this laptop, but it's becoming harder to do so.Update 4: This is a minor update to Update 3 (Below): They have pushed my Estimated repair date twice now. Originally it was going to be done on June 4th, then it got pushed to June 10th. Now it's been pushed to June 11th. (They are probably waiting on a replacement part.) But this is just not good. I have docked another star due to the issues. It is making it harder and harder to suggest buying this laptop. I really WANT to love it, and for the specs you can't go wrong. But the issues I am having is just a big issue when it comes to making me wonder about longevity. I bought this laptop to last me for a long time, and now as stated later, I have had to send it in 2x in less than a year for repairs. Almost $100 more for shipping it. The brand Samsung, has always been the name of a great, wonderful and quality product to me. Now I am really starting to wonder if they have left me like other brands have. I am just glad I picked up an Asus G46 for under $700 at Best Buy so that I could still do my schoolwork and play games. I anxiously await getting my Samsung back, if only to have the horsepower again, and will just hope that all the delays allow them to really make sure that it is in full working order. If that happens and I don't need to send it in again, ever, I will restore this to a 5-star despite the issues, I'll know that Samsung still takes care of their customers. (I'm really hoping things will be great so I can do so. :)UPDATE 3: I had to send my laptop in again for repair! This is starting to get ridiculous! I paid almost $2000 for a laptop that was suppose to last me a long time. (I bought it for gaming and so that even if the games started getting a little more advanced I figured that for the power it would last me awhile. But now after having ownership for about 10 months and needing to send it in twice now it's just mounting up to be even more expensive! It cost almost $50 to ship it both so add another almost $100 to the price I paid! I am now docking 2 stars from the perfect 5 stars I gave it. I understand things can go wrong, but twice in 1 year, scratch that less than a year? I'm sorry but this is drawing the line. I'm just hoping they will give me a whole new laptop instead. I don't know what else to say, I really want to love the laptop, it's great for the price and specs. But I'm questioning the purchase now. It's not about warranty service or the laptop itself, it's lifetime of the product, and I expected more than a year. I will update once I get my laptop back.UPDATE 2: I recently had to send my laptop in for a repair. The cpu fan seemed to not be working properly and it would overheat when running almost all my games. Fortunately it is still in warranty. I sent it about 3 days before Thanksgiving and due to The holiday it didn't get there until Monday following Thanksgiving. They repaired it. (Seems the replaced the motherboard, gpu and the keyboard. (I now have a Windows 8 style keyboard where the Start key isn't the older orb shape but is the newer windows logo) All in all, it took about 2 weeks due to holiday to get my laptop back. Which isn't really bad considering I live in Ohio and had to ship it all the way to Texas. I shipped via UPS ground with insurance (I am paranoid about that stuff.) Samsung shipped it back with 2 day Air. I was able to track both ways and knew when it would be coming so I was ready for it. The fix is good! Now I no longer overheat. Now I think that my issue was just a fluke as I don't see many with the issue, so I'm not taking any stars away and would in fact add a star for good customer support if I could. I still recommend this laptop. As you still get a good bang for your buck.UPDATE: Other have written that you can't turn down the brightness if you run the screen at 120Hz. This HAS been fixed! Download the latest video drivers from nvidia Geforce 310.33 beta or later and you CAN adjust the brightness level while on 120Hz. I already tried it with 310.33 beta and can confirm it works. Nvidia has also released another beta (310.54)today (November 12th, 2012) that I have yet to try, but can for sure say that the beta 310.33 works fine. So anyone who wants to adjust their brightness while on 120Hz, you can do so!On to the review now.I've owned quite a few gaming laptops, The Asus G73JH (I still have that one as a backup), Asus G53SW (I sold to get this one) are the closest in comparison. Though they are still decent gamer laptops. This one blows those out of the water. I have owned mine for close to 2 months now and don't have much to gripe about.Comparisons (These are comparing the differences of the Asus's and this Samsung one):* Asus used crappy Atheros Wifi cards in their laptops (I had to upgrade to in Intel card for better wifi. This one had an Intel in it already, I expected to have to change the wifi.* Both My Asus's cost a max of $1,200 but after upgrading the ram and adding a second hard drive as will as upgrading the wifi + any labor expenses they each cost as much as this Samsung.* All the laptops have a big rear. That's good for the cooling. 2 exhausts 1 is for the cpu and 1 is for the gpu. All laptops win in this category.* The Asus's felt a little cheaper built than this Samsung.* The Asus's Keyboards are of the chiclet style, this Samsung one offers something a little more traditional and feels great! A note on the G53SW and from what I have been reading all the  latest Asus Gamers seems to be a keyboard lag at times. When you type sometimes it would skip letters. This drove me crazy on the G53SW. To the point I ended up only using it's keyboard for  when I was in class. Not the case on the Samsung gamer. Typing is a dream.* I can't really compare specs since I'd be comparing 1-3 year old tech to now. But I'm a gamer, music maker, photo editor and video editor (student in the last 2) and this laptop has yet to  disappoint in any of the categories. What I thought was an awesome gaming experience on my other laptops was nothing!Negatives:I don't have much to gripe about and have been very happy with this laptop but if I would have to nitpick:* The glossy screen lid and screen are finger print magnates. Though a lot of manufactures use that stuff. It would have been nice to have a anti glare screen at least. But I'm used to it.  Considering I do a weekly cleaning and dusting of my laptops it doesn't bother me too much. I knew it would be this way by other reviews so I really can't gripe since I still bought it  knowing.* If you go to turn off Wifi with the shortcut button it turns off both wifi and bluetooth. It would have been nice to cycle or something like that. But I hardly use this function so it isn't a  big deal to me.* The power brick is large, so get a large bag for it. I'm used to large power bricks as the Asus gamers had large ones, so I can't complain on this. Ideally I would love a small power brick  but think about how much power this laptop needs. The power brick is a 200W one. My Asus's were 150W. On to any other thoughts:This laptop does get warm when under heavy use. But it's never been so hot that I can't touch it. It's to be expected. Look what's in it. The I73610 ivy bridge is comparable to one of the most powerful mobile i7 sandybridge's (last generation) The gpu is comparable to a Desktop GTX 560 (I believe but don't quote me on that). frankly I'm astounded at how well this laptop stays cool. Warm laptops aren't new to me as I've had gamer laptops before. But honestly this one actually is a little cooler. I use coretemp and msi afterburner to monitor the temps of the cpu and gpu respectively and they have been cooler than my older machines.I love the backlighting and how it changes colors for gaming mode. You can disable the screensavers that start up when you switch to gamer mode. It's under Mode Shift, then click Visual Effects.I like the design and coloring, it doesn't really scream "I'm a gaming laptop!" Unless you put stickers or stuff all over the lid. I wanted something I could potentially use for taking to a job someday that still had a lot of power and this works fine for that. The samsung label on the lid lights up like the Apple logo lights up on macbooks. Just as a side note.The 8GB Express Cache seems to work. I really can't tell other than things seem to run a little faster and boot up isn't bad. Better than my other laptops.The screen is a vibrant one. I've always liked Samsung TV's for their screens and the screen on this laptop doesn't disappoint.Battery runs for about 2 hours on normal use. Not much to write about. The battery is powering a lot of powerful components.Conclusion:One heck of a laptop, you get what you pay for, and that is a lot of bang! You could pay more for an Alienware or such and not get as good of specs (I know because I priced them at the time I bought this machine some were as high as $1000 more!) This is one heck of a machine and you can't go wrong with it. I've been happy and surprised at how will it performs, yeah I'm still getting surprised 2 months after I bought it.Notes:I wish to put the specs of my old laptops up for comparison to this one.Asus G73JH17.3" 1600x900 displayCore i7 740QM 1.73GHZ turbo to 2.93GHZ8GB DDR3 Ram500GB 7200rpm and 640GB 5400rpm drivesIntel Wifi and bluetoothAti Radeon HD 5870m 1GB GDDR5Battery gets 1.5 hours if I'm lucky on normal use.Asus G53SW (Sold to buy the Samsung)15.4" 1920x1080Core i7 2630QM 2GHZ turbo to 2.9GHZ14GB DDR3 Ram (upgraded by me)2x 500GB 7200rpm drives (2nd drive added by me)Intel 6230 Wifi and bluetooth (upgraded by me)Nvidia GTX 460M 1.5GB GDDR5Games I played on ALL machines: Torchlight, Command and Conquer Kane's Wraith, Sims 3, and Minecraft. They all played great and improved on each subsequent machine. Though Kane's Wraith couldn't do high detail on the G53SW when the nuke was fired. The Samsung has no problems. I didn't even buy Starcraft 2 until I bought the Samsung as I read people had issues with the 460M and SC:2. SC:2 plays at over 60Fps on the Samsung no problems. Minecraft would choke on some 256x and any 512x texture packs I tried on the G53SW though it was playable there were enough framerate drops for me to use only 128x or lower texture packs. Not so on the Samsung. I sued 512x packs and still got 60fps. (Contrary to belief you DO need a beefy gaming rig to play minecraft, ESPECIALLY with HD textures.Hope this helps and feel free to ask me any questions if you have them and I will help you to the best of my knowledge. This review will be updated as the time comes so please check back every so often. Cheers!

I purchased a Pavillion. Just a few months after the 1 year warranty expired the video card went out.  The problem was related to a faulty solder that could not withstand higher temperatures.  Despite the fact that the solder was defective, they said they would only fix the problem if I paid $500.  Thanks a lot HP.

The boss found these on special and got 3 for the office, and I got one.  I hate it SO MUCH! The trackpad is absolutely awful - extremely temperamental, fails to register clicks very frequently.  Additionally, the keyboard has these extra keys along the left side.  They open your email, web browser, the "hp media center", the calculator, or the print dialog.  They are pointless and extremely easy to accidentally hit, so you bring up the calculator in the middle of typing an email, for example.  Additionally, while you can remap most of the keys using hacks, you can't remap the print key without remapping the "P" key also.  Idiotic design.  Did HP's engineers ever use this?  They should be sentenced to using nothing but this machine for the next year.It's fine when using an external mouse & keyboard.  But IT'S A FRIGGIN' LAPTOP IT SHOULD BE USABLE ON MY DAMN LAP!!!

Bought from System76. I regret the purchase. I wish I had gotten a Dell XPS 13 Linux model instead. The Galago is a good collection of chips wrapped in a cheap, flimsy case. Buy a Pelican case to protect it if you get one. Again, I would recommend getting the Dell XPS 13 Linux model instead (I have no connection to Dell).

Its a good Laptop... had it for about 2 months now.. works like expected, no problems... I was kinda a skeptic cause its Amazon page really didn't have much information on the Laptop or anything.. But it arrived all brand new and in mint condition.. I am happy with this laptop :)I must revise this review.... Dell do not make good laptops. The video card is going bad.. my DVD players freeze every few seconds.. the screen just goes black for no reason... dont waste your money.. spend a little extra and upgrade to a Apple or Sony.. its pays off in the long run

My old Dell's screen went out, so I began a search on which laptop would be as reliable but have more space. I purchased this laptop (toshiba satellite c855-ds5357) around November of 2012 - I am SHOCKED at how slowly it processes. I don't have it bogged down. I can have only one window open, but videos lag and look choppy. It takes me an hour to process a Fed Ex print order that used to take me only 5-10 minutes because page changes are S-l-O-W. Customer support was a joke - they told me 2 months ago that I didn't have a warranty. It was supposed to come with a 1 year - couldn't understand their CS Rep but I knew he was trying to sell me more stuff that I didn't need.  What I needed was a reliable computer that did what it was supposed to.It's pretty - but it's garbage.Run away folks. Bad news in Toshiba land.

I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE WITH THIS PRODUCT, BECAUSE IT WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT BOUGHT IN NOV AND GIVEN AT CHRISTMAS BY TIME IT WAS FIRST USED THE 30 DAY WARRANTY FROM THE SELLER(AMAZON) HAD EXPIRED.  HAD TO GO TO THE TOSHIBA COMPANY FOR SERVICE, AND PAY FOR THE SHIPPING CONTAINER AND THE COST OF SHIPPING IT BACK TO THE REPAIR CENTER. (THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE HARDDRIVE) AFTER RECEIPT OF RETURNED REPAIR FOUND ANOTHER PROBLEM, REFUSED TO PAY AGAIN FOR SHIPPING AND THE COMPANY WOULD NOT ISSUE A REPAIR ORDER UNLESS I PREPAID THE SHIPPING, AND SO I AM STUCK WITH IT AS IS.  ON TOP OF ALL THIS, THE COMPUTER ITSELF IS NOT SUITED TO WINDOWS 8, BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TOUCH SCREEN.  BAD NEWS--NEVER AGAIN TOSHIBA.

within one week, machine slowed to a non pace. then,  pages went off line. continued to jump pages. wouldnot respond to open pages. worst computer i have experienced!

I've had the Alienware M17x for almost three years. I'm trying to get a few more months of use out of it before I take a hammer to it and then set it on fire.I'm not very tech savvy and I'm not a gamer but I spend a lot of time online. I wanted the fastest laptop available for that simple task so I ordered the Cadillac version of the M17x which set me back nearly $4,000. For that much money, the thing should perform flawlessly even if you drop it off a cliff.Since I've owned this POS, I've gone through three power cords, spent approximately 30 hours on the phone with Dell "support", had three different service visits to replace the motherboard and other components.Despite all that, the M17x overheats causing random shutdowns every hour or two. Two or three times a day the screen will just go blank and I'll have to do a forced shutdown and restart. It's ridiculous.You would be wise to not chalk my experience up to getting a random lemon. Too many others here and elsewhere have had the same or similar experiences.The bottom line is that Dell/Alienware are putting out outrageously overpriced pieces of junk. If you buy one, there is an excellent chance you'll hate yourself for it.My actual rating is negative 5 stars.

Worst Design ever....1) Weighs far to much to be a viable lap top...More of a Desktop that moves...That's forgivable.2) Overheated CONSTANTLY...If you play a game for more the 20 minutes PC will shut off and you will not be able toturn back on for 20 minutes.3) Eventually Charger cord stopped working...I replaced it only to find that the powerport on the motherboard itself had shorted out...I think it finnally overheated to the point that it cooked the internals....4) I took this thing apart to salvage what parts I could...What I found is that it has 3 fans inside...1 for each videocard and one for the CPU...Each fan is attatched to a MASSIVE copper heatsink designed to blow hotair out of the machine...Why therefore did this thing always overheat??? Because some idiot decided it would be a good idea to spraypaint the outside of the heat sink black to match the machine...This basically turns the heat sink into a heat cork....Don't Buy this thing...You will regret it...Spend the money on a good desktop...or get an ultrabook instead.

The keyboard was giving me problems from day one. By the third day, it was completely unresponsive. I called HP and they told me I could send it to them for repairs but they would keep it for three weeks. I returned the computer to Amazon (they were very helpful and issued a full refund) and bought something else. I will never buy an HP computer again.

This laptop is the slowest PC that I ever purchased. And I would never recommend windows 8.1 to anyone that actually wanted to use their laptop. After weeks of research I have finally managed to get the laptop to perform at the same speed as my old XP PC. Not to mention the fact that the datasheet for the product is incorrect as there is only one usable user memory slot.

As normal, when the computer malfunctioned and needed to be repaired, I talked to the company, trying to get the computer repaired more expeditiously, but this issue and problem was not resolved with the company so I am coming here to warn other potential buyers of my dreadful experience with this faulty computer.I purchased this computer for our daughter's high school graduation present on June 1, 2012 for college.  She is now in college without a computer! Her computer broke on August 8th and was sent to repair center for repairs on August 10th.The problem is that BACKLIGHT WENT OUT ON THE SCREEN, so you cannot see anything on the screen. (Lol, the second time I called a supervisor actually told me it wasnt broke). Well unless I want to hold a flash light up to the screen... Its broke to me!Office Depot offered a in-store warranty, but I had never had a problem with a new computer like this and I know how those policies are overpriced. Besides, I only use Square Trade for insurance on electronics, but it does not kick in if the computer is still under manufacturers warranty.It is August 29th and still no computer.  I called customer service and they put me on hold, told me that the part was still on back order. How can a new computer in inventory, not have repair parts in stock? When I called last week and saw we were getting no where, I asked to speak to a supervisor and they told me that there was NO supervisor available. Right!  I was told that the part would be available on August 28th.  It is August 29th, I called and it is still on back order.  When I asked for a supervisor again, I was told again that the supervisor was not available.  I had to argue and fuss to finally get through to someone who read some crap to me about the timeline and how they were following policy.I explained to her that my daughter is NOW in college and without her brand new Pavilion DM4 2195 laptop computer. No computer.  Now they are telling me the part will be in this week and it should be received on September 7th.HP, I will NEVER buy another computer from you, maybe you need to stick to making good products like your printers and leave the computers to companies who know how to make a quality product and have ample parts in stock in the rare event that a new computer breaks.An Angry and Frustrated College Mom!
