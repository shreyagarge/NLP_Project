old vaio sz not sure why requirement know better not ask too much point has enough power support daily tasks not gamer integrated graphics should fine has ssd best thing happened laptops since sliced bread pb j worth realworldnotjustbenchmark performance gains more portabilityso finally settled yoga lo behold yoga ticks boxes above coming slightly behind modern vaio z looks yogas processor good enough thank very much hey lenovo quality ultrabook slash tablet built windows not compatible has touch screen left something elsewe bought ours bestbuy week came wasnt amazon yet ours gray version processor g ssd along years inhome repair accidental damage protection bought lenovo directly man not close paid similar warranty coverage dell hp anyone else far knownow more specific points pros very good displayit has ips panel dont know good sharp looking x resolution good enough very goodviewing angles cant colors wash no matter where dont let resolution frenzy trick laptop not smartphone while windows apps metro apps resolution agnostic regular windows desktop doesnt play high dpi screens unless like looking tiny icons long short hires regular windows good monitor not much laptop touch screen lot better expectedthere never moment screen missed touch couldnt handle multifinger gestures has nice little dots trails show where touch drag know screen unresponsive app happens not applications respond touch especially gestures touch scrolling smoother touchpad scrolling why wife prefers move things around touch instead using touchpadkeyboard combo nice sturdy doublehinge designwhen saw yoga though thats very elegant break screen boy wrong right hinges proving stiff enough hold screen position without being uncomfortable giving time tell right seems like job done especially compared old convertible pctablet hinge designs swiveling single hinge base solid thinlight same time like ultrabook supposed beso thing weighs lbs very thin not sure much else know doesnt

empty sata slot put second ssd blew mind learned smooth sensitive large touchpad nice keyboard overall good ergonomicstouch pad nice sensitive has smooth surface builtin buttons anywhere clickable still buttons integrated bottom supports quite few multitouch gestures along win specials like slidein gestures missing few gestures more later support nicely done time comfortably finger scrolling pinching etckeyboard good better little firmer keys been used again subjective observation better thing wife doesnt like layout keys placement homeend small rightshift key etc used windows great though not flawless yetwith fuss windows let tell wont bother really like windows windows better terms under hood performance faster boot smoother throughout along visible improvements eg new task manager file copy system better multimonitor support mostlyaesthetic change new metro start screen ignore time really hate search start program like windows like better windows including good old start menu said might like new metro interface since really joy good touch screen has good got fight whose turn play wordament game last night yup good love life too cons trackpad missing gestures thanks lenovothis interesting since original synaptic drivers allow much more three finger flicks four finger touches smoother scrolling wont support tablet mode tried had issues tablet mode not being able onscreen keyboard etc not deal breaker nice lenovo supported little more especially three finger flicks nice windows not fully yetfirst let kind expected not really ms fault windows undergoing huge brave paradigm shift things kind normal transitions like purely subjective may not feel same new interface clean nice everything smooth suitable touch mostly metro parts however seemsfeels like things been done better cant put finger though feeling sometimes integration feels incomplete especially dealing relatively advanced things like picking updates ms download involves both metro settings screen classic control panel reason again nothing serious something mentionalso lot metro apps store still infancy better right nov lacking apps store mostly betaish quality android market anyone lets windows has lot more incentive developers since going millions devices very soon meeh tablet not actual tablet ipadandroid replacementdont expect throw away tablet minute little heavy large tablet however wonderful those times need screen tablecounter cant bother touchpadkeyboard wife uses read search recipes browse through easily touch normal windows apps not metro love setup

broadcom under ubuntu through comcast isp however changed att broadcom never acquire ip address finally removed broadcom wireless card using usb tplink ralink wireless dongle tlwng solved wireless

adequate not experienced ram related failure machine like laptops slots ram must considered upgrading ram cooling like pc laptops machine cooled using fan draws air bottom machine air intake duct
